8476.0,You Can Smell Hillary’s Fear,"Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. 
In the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. 
The word “unprecedented” has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it’s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. 
But that’s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary’s opponent in this election. 
The FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary’s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn’t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. 
The FBI’s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI’s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. 
The covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama’s DOJ people has gone explosively public. 
The New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, “James Comey Role Recalls Hoover’s FBI, Fairly or Not” practically admits up front that it’s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey’s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. 
James Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the “vast right wing conspiracy” was a stretch. 
Countless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what’s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. 
Senator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. 
If James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. 
Not too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner’s computer? 
Either Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he’s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary’s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. 
The only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. 
And it’s an interesting question. 
Hillary’s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. 
Pretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. 
There are two possible explanations. 
Hillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. 
But the other explanation is that her people panicked. 
Going to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It’s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that’s not hubris, it’s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. 
During the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the “positive” Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. 
There’s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. 
The Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it’s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It’s an unprecedented step born of fear. It’s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. 
Clinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. 
You can smell the fear. 
The FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It’s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that’s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn’t how you react to smoke. It’s how you respond to a fire. 
The misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. 
The Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don’t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. 
The campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It’s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It’s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. 
Hillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she’s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.

10294.0,Watch The Exact Moment Paul Ryan Committed Political Suicide At A Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
There are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. 
In a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : “Republicans, it is time to come home” https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I 
— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 
The Democratic Party couldn’t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan’s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan’s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. 
The ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a “principled” conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump’s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan – like many of his colleagues – turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. 
What’s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn’t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. 
If 2016’s very ugly election has done any good it’s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events.

3608.0,Kerry to go to Paris in gesture of sympathy,"U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday’s unity march against terrorism.

Kerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.

The visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.

The French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday’s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.

Among roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.

Kerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi’s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.

In a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as “quibbling a little bit.” He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.

“But that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,” he said.

“And I don’t think the people of France have any doubts about America’s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.”",REAL,us secretary of state john f kerry said monday that he will stop in paris later this week amid criticism that no top american officials attended sundays unity march against terrorism

While Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton just before the Democratic National Convention in July, many of his supporters remained adamant in their refusal to support the DNC-anointed candidate, pointing to WikiLeaks’ revelations that top officials at the DNC had been working behind the scenes to tip the scales in Clinton’s favor by coordinating with media figures to circulate anti-Sanders narratives. 
Rather than attribute a potential Trump presidency to the GOP nominee’s perceived popularity among voters, the closeness of this election could be credited to Hillary Clinton’s unfavorable ratings. According to RealClearPolitics, anywhere between 51 and 57 percent of voters had a negative opinion of the Democratic nominee. 
As of 11 PM Eastern, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain too close to call. Clinton has 197 electoral votes to Trump’s 187.

875.0,The Battle of New York: Why This Primary Matters,"It's primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.

Trump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and aren't giving up just yet.

A big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this year's race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.

""We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!"" Sanders recently told supporters.

While wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.

Trump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the state's 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.

""We've got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,"" Trump urged supporters.

Meanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means he'll need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.

Despite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasn't lost momentum. He's hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while he's talking about how he can win in November.

""Because if I'm the nominee, we win the General Election,"" Cruz promised his supporters. ""We're beating Hillary in the key swing states, we're beating Hillary with Independents, we're beating Hillary with young people.""

For now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.",REAL,its primary day in new york and frontrunners hillary clinton and donald trump are leading in the polls trump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the republican nomination and prevent a contested convention but sensted cruz rtexas bernie sanders dvt and ohio gov john kasich and arent giving up just yet a big win in new york could tip the scales for both the republican and democratic frontrunners in this years race for the white house clinton and trump have each suffered losses in recent contests shifting the momentum to their rivals we have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries cheer sanders recently told supporters while wins in new york for trump and clinton are expected the margins of those victories are also important trump needs to capture more than  percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the states  gop delegates that would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention weve got to vote and you know cruz is way way down in the polls trump urged supporters meanwhile sanders is hoping for a close race in the empire state a loss by  points means hell need to win  percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination despite a predicted loss in new york cruz hasnt lost momentum hes hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while hes talking about how he can win in november because if im the nominee we win the general election cruz promised his supporters were beating hillary in the key swing states were beating hillary with independents were beating hillary with young people for now cruz kasich and sanders have all moved on from new york to other states trump and clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in,"['primary', 'day', 'new', 'york', 'frontrunners', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'donald', 'trump', 'leading', 'polls', 'trump', 'vowing', 'win', 'enough', 'delegates', 'clinch', 'republican', 'nomination', 'prevent', 'contested', 'convention', 'sensted', 'cruz', 'rtexas', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'dvt', 'ohio', 'gov', 'john', 'kasich', 'arent', 'giving', 'yet', 'big', 'win', 'new', 'york', 'could', 'tip', 'scales', 'republican', 'democratic', 'frontrunners', 'years', 'race', 'white', 'house', 'clinton', 'trump', 'suffered', 'losses', 'recent', 'contests', 'shifting', 'momentum', 'rivals', 'eight', 'last', 'nine', 'caucuses', 'primaries', 'cheer', 'sanders', 'recently', 'told', 'supporters', 'wins', 'new', 'york', 'trump', 'clinton', 'expected', 'margins', 'victories', 'also', 'important', 'trump', 'needs', 'capture', 'percent', 'vote', 'statewide', 'wants', 'positioned', 'win', 'states', 'gop', 'delegates', 'would', 'put', 'one', 'step', 'closer', 'avoiding', 'contested', 'convention', 'weve', 'got', 'vote', 'know', 'cruz', 'way', 'way', 'polls', 'trump', 'urged', 'supporters', 'meanwhile', 'sanders', 'hoping', 'close', 'race', 'empire', 'state', 'loss', 'points', 'means', 'hell', 'need', 'win', 'percent', 'remaining', 'delegates', 'clinch', 'nomination', 'despite', 'predicted', 'loss', 'new', 'york', 'cruz', 'hasnt', 'lost', 'momentum', 'hes', 'hoping', 'sweep', 'delegates', 'weekend', 'hes', 'talking', 'win', 'november', 'im', 'nominee', 'win', 'general', 'election', 'cruz', 'promised', 'supporters', 'beating', 'hillary', 'key', 'swing', 'states', 'beating', 'hillary', 'independents', 'beating', 'hillary', 'young', 'people', 'cruz', 'kasich', 'sanders', 'moved', 'new', 'york', 'states', 'trump', 'clinton', 'two', 'staying', 'home', 'state', 'watch', 'results', 'come']","['GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERCENT', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL']","{'GPE': 6, 'PERSON': 5, 'CARDINAL': 4, 'NORP': 3, 'ORG': 3, 'DATE': 3, 'PERCENT': 1}",3,5,6,313,0.25170875420875416,36
6903.0,"Tehran, USA","  
I’m not an immigrant, but my grandparents are. More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. 
What I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I’ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. 
In Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders — of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry — Islamophobia — threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I’ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. 
“Death to America!” 
As a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of “Death to America!” That day would define the rest of my life. 
It was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting “Death to America!” I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. 
In a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school’s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us — if we ever wanted to see our families again — to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, “Death to America!” as they stomped on our sacred symbols. 
I was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn’t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. 
Across the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate’s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for — or against. 
“Camel Jockey,” “Ayatollah,” and “Gandhi” 
My parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including “camel jockey,” “sand-nigger,” “raghead,” “ayatollah,” and ironically, “Gandhi” (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to “other-ize” me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. 
Yet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform — all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that’s how I felt anyway as I wore my country’s uniform. 
When I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. 
Being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren’t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. 
Through patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the “otherness” of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. 
In 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. 
In the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist “us vs. them” attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. 
By the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam — or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. 
For the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America’s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. 
The Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up 
On February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as “a monster.” Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. 
The incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. 
At that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help — and it’s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon — and I, of course, joined it. 
From that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that’s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We’ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. 
Our group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. 
Nationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don’t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a “clash of civilizations.” Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an “us vs. them” and it’s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. 
As of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the “other,” the enemy. 
My Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn’t just a matter of niceties. It’s a question of life or death. It’s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. 
In many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It’s just that now I’m doing it in my own country.

in central new jersey an american kid playing little league for the raritan red sox and soccer for the raritan rovers in  i travelled with my family to our ancestral land i was only eight but old enough to understand that the iranians had lost their liberty and freedom i saw the abject despair of a people who in a desperate attempt to bring about change had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by ayatollah khomeini what i witnessed during that year in iran changed the course of my life in  at age  wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in america i enlisted in the us navy now with the rise of donald trump and his nationalist altright movement ive come to feel that the values i sought to protect are in jeopardy in iran theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders  of westerners christians and other religious minorities here in america the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants particularly muslim ones this form of nationalistic bigotry  islamophobia  threatens the heart of our nation when i chose to serve in the military i did so to protect what i viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty equality and democracy now  years later ive joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values this time right here at home death to america as a child i sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of death to america that day would define the rest of my life it was tehran the capital of iran in  i was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in western nations it had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for western teaching but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists as the gunfire drew closer i heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside marching into our building and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom as i heard voices chanting death to america i remember wondering if i would survive to see my parents again in a flash of green and black uniforms those soldiers rushed into our classroom grabbed us by our shirt collars and yelled at us to get outside we were then packed into the schools courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up almost in unison my classmates and i raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony then set ablaze and tossed still burning into the courtyard as those flags floated to the ground in flames the soldiers fired their guns in the air shouting they ordered us  if we ever wanted to see our families again  to swear allegiance to the grand ayatollah khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries i scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and horrified watched them capitulate and begin to chant death to america as they stomped on our sacred symbols i was so angry that young as i was i began to plead with them to come to their senses no one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet for the first time in my life i felt something like righteous indignation i suspect that born and raised in america i was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that i just couldnt fathom the immense danger i was in certainly i was acting in ways no native iranian would have found reasonable across the smokefilled courtyard i saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit i spotted an american flag still burning dropped to my knees and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmates feet as the soldier closed in on me i ducked and ran still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion the events of that day would come to define all that i have ever stood for  or against camel jockey ayatollah and gandhi my parents and i soon returned to the united states and i entered third grade more than anything i just wanted to be normal to fit in and be accepted by my peers unfortunately my first name nader which i changed to nate upon joining the navy and my swarthy middle eastern appearance were little help on that score eliciting regular jibes from my classmates even at that young age they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation including camel jockey sandnigger raghead ayatollah and ironically gandhi which i now take as a compliment my classmates regularly sought to otherize me in those years as if i were a lesser american because of my faith and ethnicity yet i remember that tingling in my chest when i first donned my cub scout uniform  all because of the american flag patch on its shoulder something felt so good about wearing it a feeling i still had when i joined the military it seems that the flag i tried to rescue in tehran was stapled to my heart or thats how i felt anyway as i wore my countrys uniform when i took my oath of enlistment in the us navy i gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet she cried even harder when i was selected to serve as the first muslimamerican member of the us navy presidential ceremonial honor guard  on that day i was proud too and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced being tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me it caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people somehow i grasped that if it werent for a fear of the unknown there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me often i discovered those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families friends or even strangers i realized then that if despite everything i could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness i might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me too and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate through patience humor and understanding i was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the otherness of so much that americans found scary to this day i have friends from elementary school middle school high school and the military who tell me that i am the only muslim they have ever known and that had they not met me their perspective on islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fearbased narrative that has poisoned this country since september   in  i became special assistant to the master chief petty officer of the navy and then in  i was recruited to serve at the defense intelligence agency in august  i transferred to the naval reserve in the wake of  i began to observe how so many of my fellow americans were adopting a fundamentalist us vs them attitude towards muslims and islam i suddenly found myself in an america where the scattered insults i had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form where they became something like an ideology and way of life by the time i completed my military service in  i had begun to understand that our policies in the middle eastsimilarly disturbed seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare that in turn was made possible by the creation of a new enemy islam  or rather of a portrait painted by the powersthatbe of islam as a terror religion as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert waiting to destroy us i knew that attempting to dispel through the patient approach of my childhood the kind of islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough post attacks on muslims in the us and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts for the first time in my life in a country gripped by fear i believed i was witnessing a shift en masse toward an american fundamentalism and ultranationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason not to mention fact as a boy in iran i had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country now it seemed to me in americas quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the middle east and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat the boy in the schoolyard grown up on february   three young american students yusor abusalha razan abusalha and deah shaddy barakat were executed at an apartment complex in chapel hill north carolina the killer was a guncrazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as a monster those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me my mom and i cried and prayed together for those students and their families the incident in chapel hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation i had felt so many years earlier in that smokefilled courtyard in iran i would be damned if i stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith it violated every word of the oath i had taken when i joined the military and desecrated every value i held in my heart as a sacred tenet of

7341.0,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On,"Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) 
The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who’s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. 
Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. 
According to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. 
Admitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. “I was scared, because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off, I’m going to kill you,” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror 
With a clear view of at least one intruder’s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. 
“I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,” Yale said. “That’s all lost,” since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws

Winton arranged eight trains, known as the Kindertransports (children’s transports), to evacuate the children, and died on the anniversary of the 1939 departure of the one carrying the largest number of children: 241.

4869.0,Fact check: Trump and Clinton at the 'commander-in-chief' forum,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC “commander-in-chief” forum on military and veterans issues:

• Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started.

• Trump said that President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.

• Trump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.

• Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That’s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.

• Trump said Clinton made “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.

• Trump cherry-picked Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.

The forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.

Trump said he “was totally against the war in Iraq,” while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don’t support either candidate’s strong assertions.

Our review of Trump’s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 — about six months before the war started.

Stern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so.”

In the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.

As for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump “supported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.”

But just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war “after it happened.”

The Clinton campaign cited Trump’s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.

Cavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war “looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,” and he predicted the market will “go up like a rocket” after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn’t offer an opinion.

As early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough, “I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.”

Clinton invited her audience to read Trump’s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, “Donald Trump and the Iraq War.”

Trump said President Obama set a “certain date” for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.

NBC’s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he’s not going to give details because he wants to be “unpredictable.” Trump responded, “Absolutely,” and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.

As we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.”

In the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops “a terrible decision.” As we’ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.

Once Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn’t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn’t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn’t a deal to be made with Maliki.

So, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a “certain date” for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.

It’s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.

Trump said that Obama’s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were “the first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One” when “high officials” of a host country did not appear to greet the president.

That’s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.

Trump referred to the fact that Cuba’s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama’s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China’s handling of the president’s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.

Whether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.

In 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China’s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

These and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post‘s “Fact Checker,” who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba’s and Saudi Arabia’s handling of Obama’s visits were “without precedent.” Kessler said of Trump, “once again he’s wrong, wrong, wrong.”

Kessler also noted that during Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country’s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn’t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.

Clinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.

But Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. “I would not do that,” Trump said, referring to Clinton’s claim that he supports privatization.

Trump’s campaign published “The Goals Of Donald J. Trump’s Veterans Plan” on its website last October. It doesn’t call for the VA to be completely privatized.

One of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.

“Under a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran’s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,” the plan states.

“The power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans’ healthcare dollars,” the plan says.

Trump’s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.

Trump’s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.

Trump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent “Ten Point Plan To Reform The VA” in July.

Point 10 of the plan says: “Mr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.”

Trump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.

To be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That’s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.

Trump criticized Clinton for making “a terrible mistake on Libya” when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.

Trump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be “prepared on Day One,” if elected president, to tackle “complex national security issues.”

This isn’t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.

During the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had “never discussed that subject” when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya “on a humanitarian basis” and “knock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.”

Trump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:

Even though Trump now says Clinton’s support for intervention in Libya was a “terrible mistake,” it doesn’t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi’s removal.

Trump twisted Clinton’s words when he claimed Clinton said “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as “widespread” as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system — including the issue of wait times for doctors — and what she would do to address them.

Trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as “one of the big problems” in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn’t think the VA has problems.

Lauer interrupted, noting that Clinton “went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.”

Trump insisted his version was accurate, adding, “I’m telling you … she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.”

That’s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. “The reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,” Maddow said.

Maddow asked if Clinton had any “new ideas for trying to fix” the VA. Here was Clinton’s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.

Clinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they “want it to fail” so they can privatize it.

Clinton added, “But we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.”

Indeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to “fundamentally reform veterans’ health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.” The campaign says Clinton “was outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.” The site specifically mentions Clinton’s dissatisfaction that “[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals” and promises she will “[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.”

Trump cherry-picked the part of Clinton’s response that said problems in the VA have “not been as widespread as it has been made out to be,” to make the blanket claim that Clinton is “satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration” and that “vets are being treated, essentially, just fine.” But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton’s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA

supporting us action in the country but as we wrote trump said in  that the us should go into libya on a humanitarian basis and knock gadhafi out very quickly very surgically very effectively and save the lives trump made that comment in a video posted to his youtube channel in february  even though trump now says clintons support for intervention in libya was a terrible mistake it doesnt change the fact that five years ago he supported gadhafis removal trump twisted clintons words when he claimed clinton said vets are being treated essentially just fine clinton said the problems in the department of veterans affairs were not as widespread as some republican supporters of privatization of the va claim but she went on to acknowledge problems in the va system  including the issue of wait times for doctors  and what she would do to address them trump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as one of the big problems in the va and then suggested clinton doesnt think the va has problems lauer interrupted noting that clinton went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the va trump insisted his version was accurate adding im telling you  she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the veterans administration thats not accurate the comments in question from clinton came during an interview with msnbcs rachel maddow on oct   maddow asked about talk among some republicans of abolishing the va and privatizing it the reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the va seem so intractable maddow said maddow asked if clinton had any new ideas for trying to fix the va here was clintons response with the part trump is referring to in bold clinton accused republicans of underfunding the va because they want it to fail so they can privatize it clinton added but we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern so that we can try to stymie the republican assault indeed the clinton campaign website states that clinton wants to fundamentally reform veterans health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care the campaign says clinton was outraged by the recent scandals at the va and as president she will demand accountability and performance from va leadership the site specifically mentions clintons dissatisfaction that many veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals and promises she will build a stcentury department of veterans affairs to deliver worldclass care trump cherrypicked the part of clintons response that said problems in the va have not been as widespread as it has been made out to be to make the blanket claim that clinton is satisfied with what was going on in the veterans administration and that vets are being treated essentially just fine but trump is leaving out the parts of clintons answer that acknowledged problems in the va  including the wait time issue trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns,"['hillary', 'clinton', 'donald', 'trump', 'made', 'inaccurate', 'claims', 'nbc', 'commanderinchief', 'forum', 'military', 'veterans',

2909.0,Iran reportedly makes new push for uranium concessions in nuclear talks,"Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.

The New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.

The new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.

However, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.

The Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.

The United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.

Tehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.

Officials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks — Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — insist on progressive removal after a decade.

A senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.

Limits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.

Tehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.

One official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.

Both Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.

There was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.

Iran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.

With the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.

Kerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.

1357.0,"With all three Clintons in Iowa, a glimpse at the fire that has eluded Hillary Clinton’s campaign","CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — “I had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in 1992,” Bill Clinton said by way of opening to the crowd of more than 1,100 on Saturday night.

Two days before the Iowa caucuses, Cedar Rapids tried to deliver that same old feeling to his wife, Hillary Clinton.

In the crowd, one woman held a sign that said “227 years of men. It’s HER turn!"" Some carried signs and books. Others had traveled from as far as Missouri. They had waited hours, even after the fire marshal told them there was no more room inside the high school gymnasium.

The restive crowd chanted slogans and buzzed with anticipation until finally Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton all appeared on stage hand-in-hand, an hour behind schedule. As they roared, Hillary Clinton beamed.

It has been a long slog in Iowa for the Clinton campaign, which has struggled mightily to shake the label that its supporters can’t muster the enthusiasm of its rival’s backers. As the caucuses near, and with the help of a former president, the energy level at her events are notably dialing up.

""He's a charismatic speaker,"" said Cigi Ross, 31. ""In general, I'd say he's a bigger draw for people.""

Monday night will put the campaign's months of their work to the test. Can the campaign’s organization bring out their supporters? Can the candidate energize voters?

Clinton, who seemed to draw on the higher-than-usual energy, stood at the center of it all and delivered a confident closing statement.

“What we need is a plan, and a commitment,” Clinton said at the top of her voice.

“And me, yes, thank you,” Clinton finished.

Eight years later, Clinton is in Iowa once again facing what could be a nail-biting conclusion of a hard-fought campaign. Clinton acknowledges that it isn’t just her campaign that has changed since her devastating loss here in her last run, she too has changed — and improved, she told CNN on Saturday.

""I think I am a different, and perhaps a better, candidate, so I hope that also shows,"" Clinton said in an interview with the network that morning.

Days ago, Iowa seemed to be slipping from her grasp, but campaign aides are feeling more confident now. A slew of positive news, endorsements, and the latest poll from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News indicate the bleeding has at least slowed. That poll -- considered the gold standard in Iowa -- gave Clinton a slim lead over her rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

If Democrats are wary of political dynasties, they didn’t show it. Spotting someone in the audience carrying Chelsea Clinton's book, her father remarked: ""Thank you, young woman, for holding up her book.""

Bill Clinton, who has spent days crisscrossing the state on his wife's behalf, has settled easily into this role as booster-in-chief. He lays off the policy, leaving that to his wife. He focuses instead on what he knows ""about the job.""

“There are certain, almost intangible qualities that determine whether a president succeeds or not,” Clinton said, his voice raspy, even and low. ""You need a sticker. A sticker: someone who won’t quit on you.”

""She’s the best at that I’ve ever known,” he added.",REAL,cedar rapids iowa  i had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in  bill clinton said by way of opening to the

988.0,Donald Trump’s Shockingly Weak Delegate Game Somehow Got Even Worse,"Donald Trump’s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Here’s Politico with the play-by-play from this weekend’s Colorado GOP convention, the latest scene of Trump’s delegate-securing failure:

Unlike in most other states, Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summer’s national convention in Cleveland. Instead, the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the state’s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention, and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of them—or, put another way, not the Trump campaign.

At the first two district-level contests, the billionaire’s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees, leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last Thursday’s contest, two of the three delegates on the Trump campaign’s list weren’t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees.

This past weekend’s mix-up, though, was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate, according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up, though, Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp, though, appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake, pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party's website and the printed materials distributed at the event. “We'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado,” Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC, suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. “Clearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.”

Trump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but he’s far from assured of the majority of delegates he’d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates—and leave without the nomination.",REAL,donald trumps organizational

4739.0,How women lead differently,"As more women move into high offices, they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men. But do they make better leaders?

Democratic women of the US Senate stand on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia (top). There are 20 women in the Senate – 14 Democrats and six Republicans.

Kelly Ayotte and Joni Ernst take the floor, two dynamic young US senators before a town hall of older military veterans. Between them, they represent a raft of firsts: Senator Ayotte is New Hampshire’s first female attorney general and first female Republican senator. Senator Ernst is Iowa’s first woman ever elected to either house of Congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate.

The gender dimension does not go unnoticed. Please welcome “our beautiful senators,” says the veteran who introduces them. Ayotte mentions Ernst’s military service – she’s also a war veteran. But in most ways, the woman thing doesn’t matter. This is just like any other political town hall in campaign season – one senator trying to help another who’s locked in a tight reelection race.

Yet the stakes are high. Republican control of the US Senate could hinge on Ayotte’s ability to fend off her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan. And across the country, women figure prominently in the Democrats’ strategy to retake the Senate, nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races.

Then there’s Hillary Clinton, the first woman to win a major party’s presidential nomination in the United States.

It’s enough to call 2016 Year of the Woman 2.0, following the original, 1992, when female representation in the Senate jumped from two to six. Today, female senators number 20 out of 100, with potential to reach 24, depending on how the political winds are blowing by Election Day.

Gender diversity among major world powers is also rising, with the ascension of Theresa May to the British prime ministership. If Mrs. Clinton wins in November, three of the world’s top five economies will be headed by women. (German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the other.)

But the numbers and the “firsts” invite a deeper question: Do women really lead differently? From the halls of government to corporate boardrooms, it’s a burning question.

“I think we’re good listeners, and I think that helps,” says Ayotte in an interview. “I don’t want to say my male colleagues aren’t, because plenty of them are. But I think that we listen, and so we’re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people.”

On that point, there is bipartisan agreement.

“There is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles,” Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire’s other senator, says in an interview. “We tend to be more inclusive, we’re less autocratic in our decisionmaking. We like consensus, we like to get people around the table, and so I think that has made a difference.”

Of course, there’s also the example of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D) of California, the first woman speaker of the House (2007-11). During her tenure, she was known for her ability to wield power – and in a highly partisan way. More than with previous speakers, major legislation came out of her office, not the committees. She was (and is) a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large, a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line.

And as a Roman Catholic woman, Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking. In 2010, when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue, she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of – two associations of nuns, whose support for the bill proved pivotal.

The research on women’s leadership style has been extensive – and mixed. One academic study, released in 2013, found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men. The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities, while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates’ abilities, according to the study by Peter Kuhn and Marie-Claire Villeval.

New research, released in August, looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found “little evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan.” The only difference came with Republican women, who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation, including more from the opposite party. That tendency was most pronounced on so-called women’s issues, such as education and social welfare.

“We interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se,” write the authors, Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman.

The study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008. Since then, female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch, reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House – the rough threshold for a perceived “critical mass” of representation in which women can show perceptible influence.

Indeed, since 2013, female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate, in particular, have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock. The best-known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown, when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal.

More recently, the women of the Senate – all 20 of them, dubbed “the sisterhood” – backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking, which President Obama signed into law in May 2015.

When asked for other examples, Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. “It was considered dead,” she says, “and because all the women [senators] got on board and pushed it, we were able to get it through.”

Shaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees, such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) of Alaska as chair and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington as the ranking member. “It looks like we may get an energy bill done this year, and I think that speaks to their ability to work together, and to be flexible, and move our colleagues in the House,” Shaheen says.

Behind all this female power are the women senators’ regular dinners, a chance to kick back and talk about whatever – their lives, their work, their male colleagues.

“We go by Mikulski’s rules – that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners,” says Shaheen, referring to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland, the longest-serving woman in congressional history, who is about to retire. “But yeah, they’ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships.”

As it happens, Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office. On the menu: lobsters and clam chowder. That much she will reveal. Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine was there, Shaheen says, “and we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire.”

In 2013, after the Senate’s 20 women helped end the government shutdown, Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona wondered out loud: “Imagine what they could do if there were 50 of them.”

That may sound logical, but the reality isn’t so simple. While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy, based on their life experiences, that doesn’t necessarily make them less partisan, experts say. Some of the most polarizing issues are so-called women’s issues, including health care, abortion, and equal pay.

“As long as women’s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties, there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies,” Michele Swers, a political scientist at Georgetown University, wrote in The Washington Post in 2014.

Ms. Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South – a region less hospitable to women candidates – the stronghold of the Republican Party, while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined.

And because women tend to occupy the “leftward wing” of their respective parties, Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise, the Gagliarducci-Paserman study found.

Still, none of this means women shouldn’t be more rigorously recruited for public office, say leaders of both parties.

“What you need is more good people, and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service,” says former Gov. John Sununu (R) of New Hampshire. “So what you need to do is level the playing field.”

In the business world, boosting female representation on corporate boards – now near 20 percent – has been a long-held goal. Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line. In a famous study, Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace, found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained “significantly higher financial performance” than those with the lowest representation.

But whether in the private sector or in government, women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators. Only six of the nation’s 50 governors are women, three Republicans and three Democrats. Among world leaders, fewer than two dozen are female. Among Fortune 500 companies, only 21 chief executive officers – or 4.2 percent – are women.

While legislating is an inherently collaborative process, and therefore seems to play to women’s strength, executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave, i.e., authoritatively.

“I think the more people see women in executive positions, the more they will see that as a normal course of business, and it’s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom,” says Shaheen.

But that becomes a Catch-22: Women don’t step up because they don’t see other women in those positions. “Some would call it a confidence gap,” says Liz Shuler, the No. 2 leader at the AFL-CIO. “We need to do more to increase the leadership skills-building opportunities, so that it becomes second nature for women to step up.” (See interview with Ms. Shuler here.)

But do women executives really lead differently from men? Clinton echoes other women leaders on this point: “I just think women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a win-win outcome,” she told Time magazine in January.

Meta-analyses have found that women leaders, on average, are “more likely to be democratic, collaborative, and participative” than their male counterparts, who are more likely to be “autocratic and directive” in their approach, writes Alice H. Eagly at TheConversation.com.

Of course, there are exceptions. Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Golda Meir of Israel were both known for being tough and assertive. Today, Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his team-oriented style. But for women aspiring to leadership posts, the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are “supposed to” act – i.e., nice and nonconfrontational – while still projecting authority. Clinton has faced this “double bind” in both of her presidential campaigns.

New Hampshire has a strong record of female leadership. The governor, both US senators, and one of the state’s two House members are women. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court is a woman. The chair of the state GOP is a woman.

In 2008, Granite Staters made history by electing the nation’s first majority-female state legislative body, in the state Senate. In 2013, the state made history again by sending an all-female congressional delegation to Washington. That could happen again in January.

What is it about New Hampshire that breeds women leaders? Start with a culture of independent-mindedness, and an enormous “citizens legislature” – 400 in the House, 24 in the Senate – in a state with only 1.3 million people. Members are paid just $100 a year, plus mileage. Sooner or later, the joke goes, everybody ends up serving.

“We have so much local self-governance, women have the opportunity to try things out, to see how they like public service, and then they discover that they like it and that they’re good at it, and one thing leads to the next,” says Governor Hassan in an interview in the State House.

Hassan got her start advocating for her disabled son, which caught the notice of then-Governor Shaheen, who appointed her to a state educational funding commission. That led to regular interactions with state legislators – and an introduction to her next mentor, state Sen. Sylvia Larsen, who encouraged Hassan to run for state Senate. She spent six years there, eventually rising to majority leader, losing reelection, then staging a comeback by winning the governorship.

The common denominator for most women in politics, it seems, is mentors. Ask Ayotte, New Hampshire’s junior senator, about Ruth Griffin, and her eyes light up. “I love Ruth Griffin. She’s my mentor!” Ayotte gushes, referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the New Hampshire Republican Party. (See interview with Mrs. Griffin here.)

When Griffin served on the state Executive Council – an elected board that serves as a check on the governor – she advocated strongly for Ayotte, insisting the Democratic governor reappoint the Republican Ayotte as attorney general.

Shaheen, now a mentor to others, cites as her inspiration Marilla Ricker, the first woman to run for governor of New Hampshire – before women even had the right to vote. Shaheen also speaks fondly of the late Susan McLane, a Republican state senator “who was always very good to me.” (Ms. McLane’s daughter is Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D) of New Hampshire.) Shaheen broke two gender barriers in N.H., first with her election as governor (1996), then as a US senator (2008).

Men, too, have championed women politicians here. At a recent Republican women’s chili fest in Stratham, N.H., Mr. Sununu recalls fighting to make Vesta Roy the first woman state Senate president, in 1983. “There’s that classic picture of me standing at the state Senate door, cracked open, peeking in to make sure the 13 votes I had lined up for her stayed with her,” Sununu says.

Whether New Hampshire’s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question. Only two other states have two female US senators, and five others have female governors. New Hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators; that crown belongs to Colorado, with 42 percent. The top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly Northern, and the bottom 10 mostly Southern, suggesting cultural factors.

Overall, women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats (24.6 percent) than seats in Congress (19.4 percent, House and Senate combined). At least the female “farm team” has more players than the “major league,” though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country, 50.8 percent.

For many women, reaching parity with men in government – and in business, the judiciary, the labor movement, and other spheres of life – is a deeply held goal. But a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth: Growth has nearly hit a plateau.

If progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960, women will not achieve equal representation in Congress until 2117, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Women’s representation in state legislatures, which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015, has also essentially plateaued. What’s going on?

“It’s not that women are running in droves and losing,” says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. “We know that when women run, they win at about the same rate as men do.”

Women also do just as well in fundraising as men, even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount. Part of the problem, Ms. Walsh says, comes in the recruitment process. Much of the recruiting is done by white men, and they recruit who they know – other white men.

That is particularly so among Republicans: Only 17 percent of Republican state lawmakers are women, a rate that hasn’t changed since the early 1990s. In contrast, Democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent.

In Congress (both houses), the disparity is even more stark: Only 9 percent of Republicans are female, versus 33 percent of Democrats. In the Senate alone, only six of the 20 women members are Republican.

Walsh cites several factors behind this gap: Republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts, and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries, where turnout is low and skews conservative. The GOP also has no counterpart to Emily’s List – a well-funded political action committee that helps pro-abortion-rights Democratic women get elected. And then there’s the simple fact that more women identify as Democrats, so their recruitment pool is bigger.

In New Hampshire, where both legislative chambers are controlled by the Republicans, Democratic women legislators still outnumber Republican women legislators, 73 to 49. State GOP chair Jennifer Horn says the party – nationally, not just in New Hampshire – needs a message that’s more inclusive.

“I’m being diplomatic – I think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently,” says Ms. Horn. “When we’re talking about jobs and the economy, for example, we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves.”

And then there’s the fact that, in both parties, women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited.

In the Monitor’s conversations with Ernst and Ayotte, both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the Senate before saying yes – and both brought up family issues. Without using the word “multitasking,” they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom.

“It’s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying, you can do this,” says Ernst. “It is important that you have a supportive family, even more so for women. I have a teenage daughter right now – we’re looking at colleges – and sometimes it’s hard for a woman to be away. But there are ways of making it work.”

Before running for Senate, Ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for Congress, but declined – in part, she says, because she was pregnant, but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor.

Ayotte then excuses herself. “I’ve got to pick up my daughter before 5:30 or I’m in trouble!”",REAL,as more women move into high offices they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men but do they make better leaders democratic women of the us senate stand on stage during the final night of the democratic national convention in philadelphia top there are  women in the senate   democrats and six republicans kelly ayotte and joni ernst take the floor two dynamic young us senators before a town hall of older military veterans between them they represent a raft of firsts senator ayotte is new hampshires first female attorney general and first female republican senator senator ernst is iowas first woman ever elected to either house of congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the senate the gender dimension does not go unnoticed please welcome our beautiful senators says the veteran who introduces them ayotte mentions ernsts military service  shes also a war veteran but in most ways the woman thing doesnt matter this is just like any other political town hall in campaign season  one senator trying to help another whos locked in a tight reelection race yet the stakes are high republican control of the us senate could hinge on ayottes ability to fend off her democratic challenger gov maggie hassan and across the country women figure prominently in the democrats strategy to retake the senate nominating women in six of the  competitive races then theres hillary clinton the first woman to win a major partys presidential nomination in the united states its enough to call  year of the woman  following the original  when female representation in the senate jumped from two to six today female senators number  out of  with potential to reach  depending on how the political winds are blowing by election day gender diversity among major world powers is also rising with the ascension of theresa may to the british prime ministership if mrs clinton wins in november three of the worlds top five economies will be headed by women german chancellor angela merkel is the other but the numbers and the firsts invite a deeper question do women really lead differently from the halls of government to corporate boardrooms its a burning question i think were good listeners and i think that helps says ayotte in an interview i dont want to say my male colleagues arent because plenty of them are but i think that we listen and so were picking up on where we see the common ground with other people on that point there is bipartisan agreement there is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles democratic sen jeanne shaheen new hampshires other senator says in an interview we tend to be more inclusive were less autocratic in our decisionmaking we like consensus we like to get people around the table and so i think that has made a difference of course theres also the example of rep nancy pelosi d of

8716.0,Hillary Clinton in HUGE Trouble After America Noticed SICK Thing Hidden in this Picture... * LIBERTY WRITERS NEWS,"0 
Hillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies. 
The day after losing, a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk. The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or that’s what she wants you to believe. 
Now, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the “hiker” she met. Memorize her face… 
Got it? Okay, good. 
Now what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000’s, reminds you of anyone: 
Yeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! 
Her name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. That’s actually where the older picture was taken. 
Wow! That doesn’t seem random at all, does it? 
It looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesn’t know them. 
All I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary! You lost, nobody needs to see your “chance encounters” or other promotional propaganda anymore. This is exactly why Americans ended up hating you! 
Oh well, I guess you really cannot teach an old dog new tricks. Well, in that case all that’s left to do is share this all across Facebook and the internet and expose yet another one of her Serial Lies!

3304.0,What's in that Iran bill that Obama doesn't like?,"Washington (CNN) For months, the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers.

And now, less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure.

On Tuesday, the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker's Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it.

For many in Congress, it's a very simple premise: Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran.

But for the White House, and some Democrats in Congress, that's an explosive idea that could derail the talks — and therefore must be stopped.

So what's in the bill?

Supporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations' June 30 deadline. Backers think that's only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy.

The bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings, host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal. It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments. And it spells out what the President needs to do vis-a-vis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms.

But most important, it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress' 60-day review period. And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval, then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time.

Does this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal?

Iran's primary reason for agreeing to the deal's limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief.

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal. While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions -- to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program — the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitments.

The Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted, and lifted in a timely way, which gives less encouragement to Iran.

Without the bill, could Obama lift all sanctions on Iran?

Not all, but most — at least for a limited time.

Without the Corker-Menendez bill (named after Corker and lead Democratic co-sponsor Sen. Bob Menendez), Iran could see nearly all nuclear-related sanctions at least temporarily lifted. Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed, and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office, when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive them.

If the Corker-Menendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized, Obama wouldn't be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 days.

During that 60-day review phase, the bill says Obama can't ""waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions.""

How can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anyway?

The biggest sanctions package approved by Congress, widely credited with crippling Iran's economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table, was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.

It included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines it's in the U.S. national security interest.

He wouldn't be able to permanently sunset the sanctions, though, unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world, an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soon.

The administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal -- by repealing them -- but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good one.

How would Congress weigh in during the 60-day review period?

Congress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief. Or it could do nothing, allowing Obama to implement the sanctions, and by implication the deal, after the 60 days are up.

A joint resolution disapproving of the deal would need to muster a two-thirds majority, though, to override the veto Obama has promised -- an unlikely, but not entirely unthinkable, scenario.

Are there other reasons that Obama opposes this bill?

First, he's facing a combative, Republican majority in both houses of Congress. Those Republicans have sought to undermine his negotiations with Iran at every turn. Giving those lawmakers a legislative avenue to slam the terms of an eventual deal would, at best, be a political blow to Obama and his administration's efforts to broker an agreement.

There's also the White House's argument that the executive branch has the power to broker international agreements without Congress meddling, while congressional oversight of the Iran deal would set a dangerous precedent. Most international agreements aren't treaties ratified by Congress, and Obama has argued that U.S. allies need to know they can count on those agreements holding up.

Virtually every Senate Republican supports the bill and nine Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors, including independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats. Several more on the left are leaning toward supporting the bill.

That means backers will likely pass the bill with a filibuster-proof majority. It's unclear, though, if they can muster enough Democrats willing to vote to override Obama's veto.

It's not just the numbers, though. Some powerful Democrats are supporting the legislation. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, who will become the chamber's Democratic leader when Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada retires at the end of his term, is a big proponent of the legislation.

Menendez, of New Jersey, who has been working to rally Democrats around legislation on Iran throughout the negotiations, remains the most vocal Democrat on the issue. He was the top-ranked Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping aside to face corruption charges handed down earlier in the month.

Also, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the earliest Obama backers during the 2008 campaign, has been insistent on the need for Congress to weigh in and has worked behind the scenes to make Corker's bill more palatable to Democrats -- and the White House. But so far that effort hasn't succeeded, as the White House remains opposed.",REAL,washington cnn for months the white house and congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers and now less than two weeks after a framework agreement with tehran was reached the senate foreign relations committee is planning to take up the measure on tuesday the committee will consider amendments to tennessee republican sen bob corkers iran nuclear agreement review act before deciding whether to have the full senate vote on it for many in congress its a very simple premise congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with iran but for the white house and some democrats in congress thats an explosive idea that could derail the talks  and therefore must be stopped so whats in the bill supporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal president barack obama is aiming to finalize with iran by the negotiations june  deadline backers think thats only fair since the united states is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy the bill would give congress a chance to hold hearings host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal it also requires the obama administration to quickly report to congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether iran is keeping its commitments and it spells out what the president needs to do visavis congress if iran is found violating the terms but most important it would keep obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on iran during congress day review

3078.0,The 1 chart that explains everything you need to know about partisanship in America,"While paging through Pew's best data visualizations of 2014 (it's awesome), I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics. Here it is:

The chart, which comes from Pew's amazing political polarization project, shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselves and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years. As recently as 1994, seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican.  As of 2014, it's a whopping 94 percent. Same goes for Republicans; 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today. In addition, ""the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent,"" according to Pew.

To me, this chart is so important -- particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington -- because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isn't some sort of ""only in Washington"" thing.  The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country. After all, that's who elects these people to Congress, right?

So, when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington, don't believe it.  We have the Congress we want -- even if we aren't totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is.  And, we get the results -- not many -- from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours.",REAL,while paging through pews best data visualizations of  its awesome i came across what i believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of american politics here it is the chart which comes from pews amazing political polarization project shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselves and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last  years as recently as  seven in  democrats were more consistently liberal than the median republican as of  its a whopping  percent same goes for republicans  percent of gopers were more consistently conservative than the median democrat in  while  percent are today in addition the overall share of americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from  percent to  percent according to pew to me this chart is so important  particularly in a week where a new congress arrives in washington  because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isnt some sort of only in washington thing the increasing partisanship of congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country after all thats who elects these people to congress right so when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in washington dont believe it we have the congress we want  even if we arent totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is and we get the results  not many  from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours,"['paging', 'pews', 'best', 'data', 'visualizations', 'awesome', 'came', 'across', 'believe', 'one', 'best', 'revealing', 'charts', 'state', 'american', 'politics', 'chart', 'comes', 'pews', 'amazing', 'political', 'polarization', 'project', 'shows', 'partisans', 'parties', 'grown', 'increasingly', 'unified', 'amongst', 'increasingly', 'far', 'apart', 'partisan', 'others', 'last', 'years', 'recently', 'seven', 'democrats', 'consistently', 'liberal', 'median', 'republican', 'whopping', 'percent', 'goes', 'republicans', 'percent', 'gopers', 'consistently', 'conservative', 'median', 'democrat', 'percent', 'today', 'addition', 'overall', 'share', 'americans', 'express', 'consistently', 'conservative', 'consistently', 'liberal', 'opinions', 'doubled', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'percent', 'percent', 'according', 'pew', 'chart', 'important', 'particularly', 'week', 'new', 'congress', 'arrives', 'washington', 'reveals', 'polarization', 'elected', 'officials', 'isnt', 'sort', 'washington', 'thing', 'increasing', 'partisanship', 'congress', 'direct', 'reflection', 'increasing', 'partisanship', 'country', 'thats', 'elects', 'people', 'congress', 'right', 'hear', 'people', 'decry', 'partisanship', 'elected', 'officials', 'washington', 'dont', 'believe', 'congress', 'want', 'even', 'arent', 'totally', 'honest', 'time', 'get', 'results', 'many', 'elected', 'officials', 'expect', 'country', 'polarized']","['NORP', 'DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'ORG']","{'NORP': 6, 'DATE': 4, 'ORG': 4, 'GPE': 3, 'CARDINAL': 1}",4,0,3,265,0.2736572069905403,14
2517.0,The slippery slope to Trump’s proposed ban on Muslims,"With little fanfare this fall, the New York developer who had planned to build an Islamic community center north of the World Trade Center announced that he would instead use the site for a 70-story tower of luxury condos.

Those who had rallied in opposition to the building because of its religious affiliation back in 2010 were exultant. “The importance of the defeat of the Ground Zero Mosque cannot be overstated,” Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, wrote on the website Breitbart in September. “The Ground Zero Mosque became a watershed issue in our effort to raise awareness of and ultimately halt and roll back the advance of Islamic law and Islamic supremacism in America.”

It’s all well and good that so many Republicans have condemned Donald Trump’s reprehensible call for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) was particularly forceful, calling proper attention to the “many Muslims serving in our armed forces, dying for this country.”

When he was president, George W. Bush honorably put a lid on right-wing Islamophobia. He regularly praised American Muslims and stressed that the United States needed Muslim allies to fight violent extremism. Once Bush was gone, restraint on his side of politics fell away.

Thus, Trump’s embrace of a religious test for entry to our country did not come out of nowhere. On the contrary, it simply brought us to the bottom of a slippery slope created by the ongoing exploitation of anti-Muslim feeling for political purposes.

You don’t have to reach far back in time to see why Trump figured he had the ideological space for his Muslim ban. Last month, it was Jeb Bush who introduced the idea of linking the rights of Syrian refugees to their religion. He said he was comfortable granting admission to “people like orphans and people who are clearly not going to be terrorists. Or Christians.” Asked how he’d determine who was Christian, he explained that “you can prove you’re a Christian.”

Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) took a similar view, saying , “There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.”

Trump took limits on Muslim access to our country to their logical — if un-American and odious — conclusion. Vice President Biden said that Trump was serving up “a very, very dangerous brew,” but the brew has been steeping for a long time. This is why the “Ground Zero Mosque” episode is so instructive.

The demagoguery began with the labeling of the controversy itself. As PolitiFact pointed out, “the proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it.” It was “two long blocks” away. And while a mosque was part of the proposed cultural center, the plans also included “a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, a library and art studios.”

This didn’t stop opponents from going over the top, and Newt Gingrich deserved some kind of award for the most incendiary comment of all. “Nazis,” he said, “don’t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington.”

When President Obama defended the right of developers to build the project, he was — surprise, surprise — accused of being out of touch, and Republicans were happy to make the Muslim center and Obama’s defense of religious rights an issue in the 2010 campaign.

“I think it does speak to the lack of connection between the administration and Washington and folks inside the Beltway and mainstream America,” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), who was then chairman of the committee in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. Voters, he said, felt they were “being lectured to, not listened to.” Sound familiar?

At the time, John Feehery, the veteran Republican strategist, put his finger on why Republicans were so eager to lambaste Obama’s response to the Ground Zero issue. “This will help drive turnout for the GOP base,” he said.

The Republican establishment is now all upset with Trump, but he is simply the revenge of a Republican base that took its leaders’ pandering — on Islam and a host of other issues — seriously.

You can’t be “just a little” intolerant of Muslims, any more than you can be “just a little” prejudiced against Catholics or Jews. Once the door to bigotry is opened, it is very hard to shut.

778.0,Hillary Clinton Makes A Bipartisan Appeal on Staten Island,"Hillary Clinton told a Staten Island crowd today that she was the candidate who could reach across party lines to get things done as president—pointing to her experience representing the borough in the Senate and even giving public thanks to Republican President George W. Bush.

“I have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan,” Ms. Clinton, a Democrat and former secretary of state, told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.

Ms. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today, after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch. But Ms. Clinton, perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Island’s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough, delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough, which is more conservative than the rest of New York City. The majority of its voters are registered Democrats, but the borough routinely swings Republican.

“When I ran in 2000, I didn’t carry Staten Island. When I ran in 2006, I did,” Ms. Clinton said today. “I’ve got no problem with people having political disagreements. That’s in America’s DNA, isn’t it?”

Instead, Ms. Clinton decried “deliberate efforts to set Americans against each other.” She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters on September 11, 20001, when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks. She noted the city’s mayor, the state’s governor, and the president were all Republicans.

“I did not for one minute stop and say to myself: ‘Well, I don’t know, can we work together?'” Ms. Clinton said. “How absurd is that?”

Ms. Clinton said with 3,000 people murdered, people “pulled together” and “politics was totally left behind.” She had criticized President Bush for his handling of a strong economy he “inherited” from her husband, President Bill Clinton, and for other reasons. But she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower Manhattan after the terror attacks, even as others in Washington didn’t want to spend it.

“I publicly say, ‘Thank you President George W. Bush,’ for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city,” Ms. Clinton said.

She also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks, including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the Zadroga Act. Ms. Clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience, saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would do—an allusion to her Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders—but also has to be able to keep people safe.

“Maybe we take that more seriously here in New York, but we should,” she said. “And we are going to do everything we can to keep America safe.”

She cited her work building a coalition that “brought Iran to the negotiating table,” without mentioning how controversial that final Iran deal was for President Barack Obama.

Ms. Clinton’s rally had little in common with Mr. Trump’s Staten Island event, except one thing: the crowd at both seemed to hate Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ms. Clinton mentioned his plan to spy on Muslim neighborhoods, which has also been dismissed by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.

At the mention of Mr. Cruz’s name, the crowd offered a chorus of boos.

The crowd had been hyped up for Ms. Clinton before she even arrived, and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged people to get out the vote on Tuesday.

“Hillary is the only one with the experience,” said Councilwoman Debi Rose, a Democrat who represents the borough’s North Shore. “She knows what it’s like to be in the White House. She knows the realities. She knows that living and running the White House in this country is not a reality show.”

Ms. Clinton, at the end of her speech, offered the kind of promise Staten Island always loves—and the kind it holds politicians to, if the way the Staten Island Advance repeatedly agitated and inquired about a town hall Mayor Bill de Blasio will finally hold here on Wednesday night is any indication.

“I want you to hold me accountable,” Ms. Clinton said. “I will be coming back to Staten Island when I am your president.”",REAL,hillary clinton told a staten island crowd today that she was the

3300.0,New Senate majority leader’s main goal for GOP: Don’t be scary,"Mitch McConnell has an unusual admonition for the new Republican majority as it takes over the Senate this week: Don’t be “scary.”

The incoming Senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning, reasonable majority on Capitol Hill that scores some measured conservative wins, particularly against environmental regulations, but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the health-care law. McConnell’s priority is to set the stage for a potential GOP presidential victory in 2016.

“I don’t want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that’s going to be a scary outcome. I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible, right-of-center, governing majority,” the Kentucky Republican said in a broad interview just before Christmas in his Capitol office.

It’s a far cry from his defiant declaration in 2010 that his “single most important” goal was to make President Obama a one-term president, an antagonizing oath that Democrats frequently invoke to embarrass the GOP leader — Obama won reelection comfortably in 2012, and McConnell’s party lost seats.

Now in charge at both ends of the Capitol, Republicans aim to avoid the worst excesses of the past four years and make sure the public isn’t fearful of the GOP’s course.

“There would be nothing frightening about adding a Republican president to that governing majority,” McConnell said, explaining how he wants voters to view the party on the eve of the 2016 election. “I think that’s the single best thing we can do, is to not mess up the playing field, if you will, for whoever the nominee ultimately is.”

But McConnell, who will become majority leader Tuesday, is not planning to avoid conflict altogether. He wants to use the annual spending bills to compel Obama to accept conservative policy riders that will divide Democrats, similar to the December spending bill’s inclusion of a provision benefiting Wall Street firms involved in risky derivative trades. That rider brought a liberal outcry but did not end up torpedoing the bill, which had Obama’s support.

McConnell has been coaching his members to understand that, in the initial rounds, they will have to almost unanimously support the budget outline and the spending bills, because few Democrats will support their policy riders.

With 54 Republicans in his caucus, McConnell knows that he’s a long way from getting 67 votes to override an Obama veto and that it won’t even be easy getting six Democrats to regularly support legislation so that he can overcome likely filibusters led by the incoming minority leader, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). Still, on some issues, such as energy and taxes on the health industry, McConnell thinks there’s enough bipartisan support to get bills onto Obama’s desk.

“They’d like to be relevant. They’d like to be part of the process,” he said of discussions with some rank-and-file Democrats. “Assuming we will have on most issues a largely unified conference — I don’t expect that on everything — it wouldn’t take a whole lot of Democrats to actually pass legislation in the Senate.”

But McConnell said those who are “craving some grand deal as a way to measure the next two years” should lower their expectations. He’s very skeptical of such bargains with Democrats on tough issues such as immigration and entitlement reform. Instead, he believes three issues have potential common ground: international trade deals, an overhaul of the tax code and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects.

“Could the country use a lot more? You bet. But there’s no way you can overcome a reluctant president on something really large,” McConnell said. The best he can do on some of those bigger issues is force Obama to break out his veto pen so there is a clear set of Democratic policy stances Republicans can campaign against in 2016.

Democrats are dubious of McConnell’s pledge to avert edge-of-the-cliff moments. They believe he will run into the same problems that have bedeviled House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) during the past four years — including the inability to corral rabble-rousers such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to support an agenda that conservative critics will probably view as not bold enough in challenging Obama. Appeasing those far-right conservatives will lead to an agenda that Democrats hope to exploit in 2016.

“What Senator McConnell wants people to think and what they will think when they see the results for themselves are two very different things,” said Reid’s spokesman, Adam Jentleson. “Senator McConnell heads a caucus that is obsessed with rigging the game against working people in favor of wealthy special interests. That’s a scary fact indeed, and he won’t be able to hide it.”

While McConnell’s office is adorned with a portrait of Kentucky’s only other Senate majority leader — Alben W. Barkley, whose tenure was often marked by clashes with his own party’s president, Franklin D. Roosevelt — his model more resembles that of George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader from 1989 through 1994.

Without ever shutting down the government, Mitchell stared down a president of the opposite party, George H.W. Bush, and won several liberal victories in a 1990 budget showdown. Mitchell also delivered a slew of legislation to Bush’s desk that drew a veto, helping frame the debate for the 1992 election on domestic policy.

McConnell has recently studied other two-term presidents on how often they vetoed legislation in their last two years in office. Obama has issued only two minor vetoes over technical matters, largely because the previously Democratic-run Senate prevented anything from reaching his desk that he opposed.

McConnell suggested that a veto strategy would help clarify issues for voters. “I think his bureaucracy across the board has done a lot of damage to the country. . . . I’d at least like for him to have to personally take responsibility for it, even if he in the end decides to veto the bill over some restriction on EPA regulations.”

McConnell is keenly aware of the challenges of reining in some of the impulses that his fellow Republican lawmakers have developed over eight straight years in the minority.

The first test will come on an energy debate, which could begin by the end of this week. McConnell is trying to keep his side from offering amendments not related to energy issues. In recent years, when some rank-and-file Republicans wanted to stop the Senate in its tracks, they would threaten amendments related to how Congress gets its health care.

“I’ve asked my members to restrain themselves,” he said.

Restraint has been hard to come by in this political era, particularly because a small army of conservative groups has made it a mission to push Republicans to the most strident stands, even if it means shutting down the government or risking default on the national debt.

McConnell faced some of those groups firsthand when they supported his 2014 primary challenger, and he faced a grinding general election against a Democrat who was well financed.

It cost nearly $30 million from his campaign war chest and tens of millions of dollars more from outside groups. Winning both races handily, McConnell is delivering a message to Republicans on how to behave heading into 2016.

“Don’t try to reinvent yourself. Be yourself, number one. And don’t be afraid of a primary. We will win all the primaries. We did it in ’14. We will do it in ’16,” McConnell said.

Shortly after Election Day this fall, McConnell sat down with Obama for a rare one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office, a huddle that both sides kept largely secret. In the pre-Christmas interview, McConnell acknowledged that the meeting’s purpose was only to discuss areas where the president and Republicans might find bipartisan agreement — because their disagreements on other issues were too in­trac­table.

That meeting, he said, focused on trade deals, a tax code overhaul and infrastructure funding. “Can we get there on tax reform, trade, infrastructure?” he said.

He eschewed the idea of holding the debt ceiling hostage to gain spending-cut concessions from Obama, a tool Republicans had to use before because they were in the minority.

“We are in the majority. We can pass a budget. We can determine how much we’re going to spend,” he said.

Avoiding those moments could make for a less “scary” Congress, giving the Republicans a better chance in 2016 to hit the trifecta and gain the White House. His own horse is already chosen, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), but don’t expect McConnell to be out on the campaign trail or doing any other favors for his home-state colleague.

“I’m going to be supporting Rand Paul. But he knows that beyond that, I won’t be involved in presidential politics. I’ve got a big job here,” he said.",REAL,mitch mcconnell has an unusual admonition for the new republican majority as it takes over the senate this week dont be scary the incoming senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning reasonable majority on capitol hill that scores some measured conservative wins particularly against environmental regulations but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the healthcare law mcconnells priority is to set the stage for a potential gop presidential victory in  i dont want the american people to think that if they add a republican president to a republican congress thats going to be a scary outcome i want the american people to be comfortable with the fact that the republican house and senate is a responsible rightofcenter governing majority the kentucky republican said in a broad interview just before christmas in his capitol office its a far cry from his defiant declaration in  that his single most important goal was to make president obama a oneterm president an antagonizing oath that democrats frequently invoke to embarrass the gop leader  obama won reelection comfortably in  and mcconnells party lost seats now in charge at both ends of the capitol republicans aim to avoid the worst excesses of the past four years and make sure the public isnt fearful of the gops course there would be nothing frightening about adding a republican president to that governing majority mcconnell said explaining how he wants voters to view the party on the eve of the  election i think thats the single best thing we can do is to not mess up the playing field if you will for whoever the nominee ultimately is but mcconnell who will become majority leader tuesday is not planning to avoid conflict altogether he wants to use the annual spending bills to compel obama to accept conservative policy riders that will divide democrats similar to the december spending bills inclusion of a provision benefiting wall street firms involved in risky derivative trades that rider brought a liberal outcry but did not end up torpedoing the bill which had obamas support mcconnell has been coaching his members to understand that in the initial rounds they will have to almost unanimously support the budget outline and the spending bills because few democrats will support their policy riders with  republicans in his caucus mcconnell knows that hes a long way from getting  votes to override an obama veto and that it wont even be easy getting six democrats to regularly support legislation so that he can overcome likely filibusters led by the incoming minority leader sen harry m reid dnev still on some issues such as energy and taxes on the health industry mcconnell thinks theres enough bipartisan support to get bills onto obamas desk theyd like to be relevant theyd like to be part of the process he said of discussions with some rankandfile democrats assuming we will have on most issues a largely unified conference  i dont expect that on everything  it wouldnt take a whole lot of democrats to actually pass legislation in the senate but mcconnell said those who are craving some grand deal as a way to measure the next two years should lower their expectations hes very skeptical of such bargains with democrats on tough issues such as immigration and entitlement reform instead he believes three issues have potential common ground international trade deals an overhaul of the tax code and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects could the country use a lot more you bet but theres no way you can overcome a reluctant president on something really large mcconnell said the best he can do on some of those bigger issues is force obama to break out his veto pen so there is a clear set of democratic policy stances republicans can campaign against in  democrats are dubious of mcconnells pledge to avert edgeofthecliff moments they believe he will run into the same problems that have bedeviled house speaker john a boehner rohio during the past four years  including the inability to corral rabblerousers such as sen ted cruz rtex to support an agenda that conservative critics will probably view as not bold enough in challenging obama appeasing those farright conservatives will lead to an agenda that democrats hope to exploit in  what senator mcconnell wants people to think and what they will think when they see the results for themselves are two very different things said reids spokesman adam jentleson senator mcconnell heads a caucus that is obsessed with rigging the game against working people in favor of wealthy special interests thats a scary fact indeed and he wont be able to hide it while mcconnells office is adorned with a portrait of kentuckys only other senate majority leader  alben w barkley whose tenure was often marked by clashes with his own partys president franklin d roosevelt  his model more resembles that of george mitchell the democratic majority leader from  through  without ever shutting down the government mitchell stared down a president of the opposite party george hw bush and won several liberal victories in a  budget showdown mitchell also delivered a slew of legislation to bushs desk that drew a veto helping frame the debate for the  election on domestic policy mcconnell has recently studied other twoterm presidents on how often they vetoed legislation in their last two years in office obama has issued only two minor vetoes over technical matters largely because the previously democraticrun senate prevented anything from reaching his desk that he opposed mcconnell suggested that a veto strategy would help clarify issues for voters i think his bureaucracy across the board has done a lot of damage to the country    id at least like for him to have to personally take responsibility for it even if he in the end decides to veto the bill over some restriction on epa regulations mcconnell is keenly aware of the challenges of reining in some of the impulses that his fellow republican lawmakers have developed over eight straight years in the minority the first test will come on an energy debate which could begin by the end of this week mcconnell is trying to keep his side from offering amendments not related to energy issues in recent years when some rankandfile republicans wanted to stop the senate in its tracks they would threaten amendments related to how congress gets its health care ive asked my members to restrain themselves he said restraint has been hard to come by in this political era particularly because a small army of conservative groups has made it a mission to push republicans to the most strident stands even if it means shutting down the government or risking default on the national debt mcconnell faced some of those groups firsthand when they supported his  primary challenger and he faced a grinding general election against a democrat who was well financed it cost nearly  million from his campaign war chest and tens of millions of dollars more from outside groups winning both races handily mcconnell is delivering a message to republicans on how to behave heading into  dont try to reinvent yourself be yourself number one and dont be afraid of a primary we will win all the primaries we did it in  we will do it in

6155.0,‘Inferno’ and the Overpopulation Myth,"Mises.org November 1, 2016 Inferno is a great thriller, featuring Tom Hanks reprising his role as Professor Robert Langdon. The previous movie adaptations of Dan Brown’s books ( Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code ) were a success, and I expect Inferno will do well in theaters, too. Langdon is a professor of symbology whose puzzle solving skills and knowledge of history come in high demand when a billionaire leaves a trail of clues based on Dante’s Inferno to a biological weapon that would halve the world’s population. The villain, however, has good motives. As a radical Malthusian, he believes that the human race needs halving if it is to survive at all, even if through a plague. Malthus’s name is not mentioned in the movie, but his ideas are certainly there. Inferno provides us an opportunity to unpack this overpopulation fear, and see where it stands today. Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) thought that the potential exponential growth of population was a problem. If the population increases faster than the means of subsistence, then, “The superior power of population cannot be checked without producing misery or vice.” Is overpopulation a problem? The economics of population size tell a different, less scary, story. While it is certainly possible that some areas can become too crowded for some people’s preferences, as long as people are free to buy and sell land for a mutually agreeable price, overcrowding will fix itself. As an introvert who enjoys nature and peace and quiet, I am certainly less willing to rent an apartment in the middle of a busy, crowded city. The prices I’m willing to pay for country living versus city living reflect my preferences. And, to the extent that others share my preferences or even have the opposite preferences, the use and construction of homes and apartments will economize in both locations. Our demands and the profitability of the varied real estate offerings keep local populations in check. But what about on a global scale? The Inferno villain was concerned with world population. He stressed the urgency of the situation, but I don’t see any reason to worry. Google tells me that we could fit the entire world population in Texas and everybody would have a small, 100 square meter plot to themselves. Indeed, there are vast stretches of land across the globe with little to no human inhabitants. Malthus and his ideological followers must have a biased perspective, only looking at the crowded streets of a big city. If it’s not land that’s a problem, what about the “means of subsistence”? Are we at risk of running out of food, medicine, or other resources because of our growing population? No. A larger population not only means more mouths to feed, but also more heads, hands, and feet to do the producing. Also, as populations increase, so does the variety of skills available to make production even more efficient. More people means everybody can specialize in a more specific and more productive comparative advantage and participate in a division of labor. Perhaps this question will drive the point home: Would you rather be stranded on an island with two other people or 20 other people? Malthus wouldn’t be a Malthusian if he could see this data The empirical evidence is compelling, too. In the graph below, we can see the sort of world Malthus saw: one in which most people were barely surviving, especially compared to our current situation. Our 21st-century world tells a different story. Extreme poverty is on the decline even while world population is increasing. Hans Rosling, a Swedish medical doctor and “celebrity statistician,” is famous for his “Don’t Panic” message about population growth. He sees that as populations and economies grow, more have access to birth control and limit the size of their families. In this video , he shows that all countries are heading toward longer lifespans and greater standards of living. Finally, there’s the hockey stick of human prosperity. Estimates of GDP per capita on a global, millennial scale reveal a recent dramatic turn. The inflection point coincides with the industrial revolution. Embracing the productivity of steam-powered capital goods and other technologies sparked a revolution in human well-being across the globe. Since then, new sources of energy have been harnessed and computers entered the scene. Now, computers across the world are connected through the internet and have been made small enough to fit in our pockets. Goods, services, and ideas zip across the globe, while human productivity increases beyond what anybody could have imagined just 50 years ago. 
I don’t think Malthus himself would be a Malthusian if he could see the world today.

636.0,Anti-Trump forces seek last-ditch delegate revolt,"Washington (CNN) The faction of the GOP that is unhappy with Donald Trump as the party's presumptive nominee has one last plan to stop the mogul: staging an all-out delegate revolt at the Republican National Convention.

The far-fetched idea is the latest reflection of a campaign cycle that has been anything but ordinary, and stems from a continuing dissatisfaction among some conservative stalwarts with how Trump is behaving and running his campaign. But two longtime GOP veterans says they wouldn't bet on the effort working.

The effort comes at a rough time for the GOP. As the Democratic Party's heaviest hitters, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, line up behind Hillary Clinton and against Trump, Republicans have been forced to criticize their own nominee. Recent comments from Trump about a federal judge's Mexican heritage have drawn widespread rebuke and put GOP leaders in a corner as they defend their endorsement of Trump while disavowing his comments.

One of the vocal advocates for a delegate revolt is conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who has also been actively seeking a candidate to mount an independent bid against Trump, thus far to no avail.

Kristol tweeted late Thursday that the idea of a ""conscience convention,"" where delegates are free to vote for whomever they want to, is also appealing.

""I've been focused on independent candidacy, & still am. But struck by sudden level of interest in possible delegate revolt at convention,"" Kristol tweeted. He added: ""A Convention of Conscience in Cleveland would be quite something. Made easier by fact Trump only won minority of total primary votes anyway.""

Bob Vander Plaats, the head of The Family Leader, an influential social conservative group in Iowa, told CNN's Kate Bolduan Friday morning that ""everything does need to be on the table"" at the convention, though he stopped short of calling for a revolt on the convention floor.

""We want a principled conservative and disciplined candidate who is the standard-bearer of this party,"" said Vander Plaats, who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the primaries. He said Trump has time before the convention to ""have the concerns laid to rest.""

""All I'm doing is adapting to the circumstances,"" Kendal Unruh told ABC. ""I certainly believe Trump's demagogic racist comments are hurting him.""

The rules enacted by the previous convention, which govern in 2016 until delegates pass a new set of rules, state that even if a delegate casts a ballot for a candidate other than one they are bound to, the convention secretary will record their bound vote.

In order to change that rule, the 112 delegates (two from each state and territory) on the Rules Committee would have to pass different rules and bring those to the floor of the convention, where a majority of delegates present would have to approve them.

Rules expert and RNC veteran Jim Bopp, an Indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the RNC Rules Committee, said he has spoken with people who want to ""keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny Trump the nomination,"" but he said he wouldn't bet on any changes.

""I would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process,"" Bopp told CNN. ""I think it's highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nomination.""

Bopp said there's also a counter movement within Rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the convention.

Rules Committee and Oregon RNC member Solomon Yue is behind that effort, and has been pushing the RNC this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates. He tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the convention.

Yue says with roughly 80% of the convention delegates being either Trump or Cruz backers, the anti-Trump forces don't have much strength.

""The common denominator of the delegates is anti-establishment, anti-Washington,"" Yue said. ""And if you think about 'Never Trump' people, they are representing Washington and the establishment.""

Part of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime RNC veteran Curly Haugland, from North Dakota, and a book he co-wrote with public policy consultant Sean Parnell. ""Unbound"" uses the history of the RNC to make the case that RNC rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscience.

""What Curly and I are contending is that because of RNC rules, there is no such thing as binding,"" Parnell told CNN, saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern pre-convention during the delegate selection process.

But Parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floor.

""It would be messy. Good television though,"" Parnell said. ""I would not call it likely. My hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote, and it's going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that. But I think unless Donald Trump actually does go shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, I don't think this is going to cost him the nomination.""

Neither the Trump campaign nor Republican National Committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revolt.

There has been intense focus on the Rules Committee for months, going back to when there was a possibility of no Republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright. With the prospect of a contested convention, the Cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the Rules Committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support Rules that would benefit Cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballots.

But after Cruz lost Indiana soundly and suspended his campaign, the prospect of a contested convention vanished and Trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nomination.

Meanwhile, the Cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the convention.

Though some in the party have never warmed to Trump, the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after Trump's comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own party.

Trump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture Trump University, saying the Indiana-born judge's Mexican ancestry could bias him against Trump. The mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico in making the comments.

Though the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments, his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called the remarks ""the textbook definition of a racist comment.""

Still, only a small handful of Republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of Trump. Vulnerable Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk disavowed Trump this week and said he could not endorse the party's nominee after all, but Ryan, McConnell and others have stood by their endorsements, saying Clinton would be a worse

755.0,Sanders Trounces Clinton in W. Va. -- But Will It Make a Difference?,"Meanwhile, Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up more delegates in the two states than Hillary Clinton.

The Vermont senator's still way behind, but says he's not giving up, calling his win in West Virginia ""tremendous.""

Clinton still holds a commanding delegate lead, but Sanders still has the fight in him.

""We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination!"" he declared.

But Sanders' quest appears to be almost impossible, with Clinton 94 percent of the way to winning the nomination.

""I am, if I am so fortunate enough as to be the nominee - I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump come the fall,"" she said.

Still, Clinton faces the FBI investigation of her email scandal.

In addition, her loss in West Virginia, a state she took in 2008, was payback for her statements in March that a lot of coal miners and coal companies would be out of business.

She's also polling badly among whites, men, and young people, with many loyal Sanders supporters vowing to never vote for her.

Meanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump kept rolling, winning West Virginia and Nebraska.

The billionaire told the Associated Press he's looking at five or six people as his running mate, all with deep political experience.

One person that Trump will likely not be considering is Sen. Marco Rubio, who told CNN he disagrees with Trump's ""America first"" foreign policy.

""I have well defined differences with the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party,"" Rubio said. ""And like millions of Republicans, you try to reconcile those two things.""

Trump will be meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday with Republican leaders, a group he has railed against, to try to patch up the public differences they've had.

Unifying the Democrats is going to be an issue for Clinton too, as many Sanders voters have said they wouldn't vote for her.

So, after tough primary battles, both parties are facing the question of how to work together against each in the general election this fall.",REAL,meanwhile democrat bernie sanders picked up more delegates in the two states than hillary clinton the vermont senators still way behind but says hes not giving up calling his win in west virginia tremendous clinton still holds a commanding delegate lead but sanders still has the fight in him we are in this campaign to win the democratic nomination he declared but sanders quest appears to be almost impossible with clinton  percent of the way to winning the nomination i am if i am so fortunate enough as to be the nominee  i am looking forward to debating donald trump come the fall she said still clinton faces the fbi investigation of her email scandal in addition her loss in west virginia a state she took in  was payback for her statements in march that a lot of coal miners and coal companies would be out of business shes also polling badly among whites men and young people with many loyal sanders supporters vowing to never vote for her meanwhile on the republican side trump kept rolling winning west virginia and nebraska the billionaire told the associated press hes looking at five or six people as his running mate all with deep political experience one person that trump will likely not be considering is sen marco rubio who told cnn he disagrees with trumps america first foreign policy i have well defined differences with the presumptive nominee of the republican party rubio said and like millions of republicans you try to reconcile those two things trump will be meeting on capitol hill thursday with republican leaders a group he has railed against to try to patch up the public differences theyve had unifying the democrats is going to be an issue for clinton too as many sanders voters have said they wouldnt vote for her so after tough primary battles both parties are facing the question of how to work together against each in the general election this fall,"['meanwhile', 'democrat', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'picked', 'delegates', 'two', 'states', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'vermont', 'senators', 'still', 'way', 'behind', 'says', 'hes', 'giving', 'calling', 'win', 'west', 'virginia', 'tremendous', 'clinton', 'still', 'holds', 'commanding', 'delegate', 'lead', 'sanders', 'still', 'fight', 'campaign', 'win', 'democratic', 'nomination', 'declared', 'sanders', 'quest', 'appears', 'almost', 'impossible', 'clinton', 'percent', 'way', 'winning', 'nomination', 'fortunate', 'enough', 'nominee', 'looking', 'forward', 'debating', 'donald', 'trump', 'come', 'fall', 'said', 'still', 'clinton', 'faces', 'fbi', 'investigation', 'email', 'scandal', 'addition', 'loss', 'west', 'virginia', 'state', 'took', 'payback', 'statements', 'march', 'lot', 'coal', 'miners', 'coal', 'companies', 'would', 'business', 'shes', 'also', 'polling', 'badly', 'among', 'whites', 'men', 'young', 'people', 'many', 'loyal', 'sanders', 'supporters', 'vowing', 'never', 'vote', 'meanwhile', 'republican', 'side', 'trump', 'kept', 'rolling', 'winning', 'west', 'virginia', 'nebraska', 'billionaire', 'told', 'associated', 'press', 'hes', 'looking', 'five', 'six', 'people', 'running', 'mate', 'deep', 'political', 'experience', 'one', 'person', 'trump', 'likely', 'considering', 'sen', 'marco', 'rubio', 'told', 'cnn', 'disagrees', 'trumps', 'america', 'first', 'foreign', 'policy', 'well', 'defined', 'differences', 'presumptive', 'nominee', 'republican', 'party', 'rubio', 'said', 'like', 'millions', 'republicans', 'try', 'reconcile', 'two', 'things', 'trump', 'meeting', 'capitol', 'hill', 'thursday', 'republican', 'leaders', 'group', 'railed', 'try', 'patch', 'public', 'differences', 'theyve', 'unifying', 'democrats', 'going', 'issue', 'clinton', 'many', 'sanders', 'voters', 'said', 'wouldnt', 'vote', 'tough', 'primary', 'battles', 'parties', 'facing', 'question', 'work', 'together', 'general', 'election', 'fall']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'NORP', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON']","{'PERSON': 6, 'CARDINAL': 6, 'NORP': 5, 'GPE': 5, 'ORG': 5, 'DATE': 1}",5,6,5,329,0.15358796296296298,23
626.0,Donald Trump Is Changing His Campaign Slogan to Prove He’s Not Racist,"After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to “make America great again,” Trump now says he’s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.

“You know, I have the theme ‘make America great again,’ and I've added a couple of things,” Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. “Right now I’m adding make America great again—I’m adding ‘for everyone,’ because it’s really going to be for everyone. It’s not going to be for a group of people, it’s going to be for everyone. It’s true.”

The allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trump’s statement the “textbook definition of a racist comment.”

Trump, who hasn’t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.

“I am the least racist person. The least racist person that you’ve ever seen. I mean give me a break,” he said at the rally. “I am the least racist person that you’ve ever looked at, believe me.”",REAL,after a week of nonstop criticism from democrats and republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged donald trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive while the presumptive gop has long promised to make america great again trump now says hes adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how nonracist he really is you know i have the theme make america great again and ive added a couple of things trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in richmond virginia on friday night right now im adding make america great againim adding for everyone because its really going to be for everyone its not going to be for a group of people its going to be for everyone its true the allegedly amended slogan which has yet to appear on any official signage or trump merchandise comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of june repeatedly denouncing gonzalo curiel the federal judge of mexican heritage presiding over the trump university class action lawsuit as inherently biased against him curiel was born in indiana his comments were widely condemned by the washington political establishment including senate minority leader mitch mcconnell who suggested he may be an idiot and house speaker paul ryan who called trumps statement the textbook definition of a racist comment trump who hasnt apologized or taken back any of his comments indicated on friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist i am the least racist person the least racist person that youve ever seen i mean give me a break he said at the rally i am the least racist person that youve ever looked at believe me,"['week', 'nonstop', 'criticism', 'democrats', 'republicans', 'alike', 'comments', 'many', 'condemned', 'racially', 'charged', 'donald', 'trump', 'claims', 'altering', 'campaign', 'little', 'inclusive', 'presumptive', 'gop', 'long', 'promised', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'trump', 'says', 'hes', 'adding', 'two', 'words', 'slogan', 'illustrate', 'nonracist', 'really', 'know', 'theme', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'ive', 'added', 'couple', 'things', 'trump', 'announced', 'supporters', 'campaign', 'rally', 'richmond', 'virginia', 'friday', 'night', 'right', 'im', 'adding', 'make', 'america', 'great', 'againim', 'adding', 'everyone', 'really', 'going', 'everyone', 'going', 'group', 'people', 'going', 'everyone', 'true', 'allegedly', 'amended', 'slogan', 'yet', 'appear', 'official', 'signage', 'trump', 'merchandise', 'comes', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'spent', 'first', 'half', 'june', 'repeatedly', 'denouncing', 'gonzalo', 'curiel', 'federal', 'judge', 'mexican', 'heritage', 'presiding', 'trump', 'university', 'class', 'action', 'lawsuit', 'inherently', 'biased', 'curiel', 'born', 'indiana', 'comments', 'widely', 'condemned', 'washington', 'political', 'establishment', 'including', 'senate', 'minority', 'leader', 'mitch', 'mcconnell', 'suggested', 'may', 'idiot', 'house', 'speaker', 'paul', 'ryan', 'called', 'trumps', 'statement', 'textbook', 'definition', 'racist', 'comment', 'trump', 'hasnt', 'apologized', 'taken', 'back', 'comments', 'indicated', 'friday', 'realized', 'words', 'negative', 'effect', 'campaign', 'declared', 'racist', 'least', 'racist', 'person', 'least', 'racist', 'person', 'youve', 'ever', 'seen', 'mean', 'give', 'break', 'said', 'rally', 'least', 'racist', 'person', 'youve', 'ever', 'looked', 'believe']","['DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'GPE', 'TIME', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE']","{'DATE': 3, 'NORP': 3, 'PERSON': 3, 'GPE': 3, 'ORG': 2, 'CARDINAL': 1, 'TIME': 1}",2,3,3,295,0.06804029304029303,68
691.0,Pure chaos: Donald Trump’s campaign management offers a glimpse into his governing style (spoiler alert: it’s terrible),"If you want a glimpse into a presidential candidate’s governing style, take a look at his campaign. How does he build an organization? How does he manage personnel? How does he delegate responsibility? Does he value loyalty or honesty in advisers? It’s hardly conclusive, but how a candidate deals with these challenges says a lot about what they’d prioritize as president.

The presumptive Republican nominee has managed his campaign the way he manages his casinos or his realty TV program: haphazardly and with an unearned arrogance. Everything’s about the brand and non-sycophants are cast aside. Getting it right is far less important than being right. Thus, when prompted by advisers to dial down the rhetoric and think more about his long-term viability, Trump has resisted. He’s yet to understand how different a primary and a general election are, and he’s too cocksure to listen to anyone who tries to explain it.

Trump isn’t as stupid as he pretends to be, but his confidence seems to scale with his ignorance, and that’s a dangerous trait in a president, given how consequential each decision can be. As a candidate, a confident idiot can make a lot of noise and fool a lot of voters. But you can’t lead that way. As president, Trump would need the sober advice of serious professionals. Considering how little he understands about the job and the world, this is especially true in his case.

Based on the latest behind-the-scenes reports on Trump’s campaign (as well as his entire history in real estate and television), it’s unlikely he would govern with the humility and self-awareness required. The campaign has undergone several shake-ups in recent months, with key staffers like Corey Lewandowski being demoted to make way for veteran operatives like Paul Manafort. Trump’s approach has remained very much the same, however. Everyone he brings in bends to his will or is replaced by someone who does.

Things have gotten more chaotic in the last week or so, as Rick Wiley was fired as the campaign’s national political director. Wiley was known to assert himself in ways that alienated Trump and his loyalists. The Washington Post’s Sean Sullivan and Robert Costa summarized the broader situation over the weekend: “For the last two months, Donald Trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars, staff reshuffling and dueling power centers. But tensions are more than typical campaign chaos: They illustrate how Trump likes to run an organization, whether it’s a real estate venture or his presidential bid. Interviews with current and former Trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates, wary of delegating major decisions, scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him.” These are the management techniques of a brand-hustling magnate, not a president of the United States. Trump’s dictatorial approach works well on the campaign trail, but it’d be a disaster in office. A president has to persuade and compromise. The capacity to admit ignorance is equally important. Trump, by all accounts, has no interest in any of these things. Trump doesn’t know what he needs to know in order to be president, nor does he care that he doesn’t know. If his campaign is any indication, he’ll hire people to ensure his veil of ignorance is never cracked. That kind of megalomania is why Trump is who he is – it’s part of his outsized persona. It’s also the clearest indicator we have of the kind of president he’d be.",REAL,if you want a glimpse into a presidential candidates governing style take a look at his campaign how does he build an

They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report – November 1, 2016: Syrian Military Deploys Advanced T-90 Battle Tanks to Aleppo By South Front on November 1, 2016 …from SouthFront 
The Syrian military has deployed advanced Russian-made T-90 main battle tanks to western Aleppo, according to the video released on October 31. T-90 MBTs were observed in the Minyan area where they were participating in operations against Jaish al-Fatah, a Jabhat al-Nusra-led coalition of militant groups. Last weekend, elite units of the Syrian Army’s Tiger Forces and the Desert Hawks Brigade were deployed in Aleppo to counter the militants’ offensive operation to capture the al-Assad Military Academy and the nearby areas. Both formations operate T-90 MBTs supplied by Moscow over the last year. The government forces massively use tanks, artillery, warplanes and helicopters to attrit Jaish al-Fatah’s manpower in non-populated urban areas. 
Experts note that the jihadists have also concentrated a high number of experienced troops, artillery, rocket launchers and military equipment at a restricted front in western Aleppo. To do this, they had been pushed to use almost all their resources from the rear bases in Idlib province. If Jabhat al-Nusra is not able to achieve a decided success in clashes with the government forces soon, this will lead to its total collapse as a powerbroker in the war. The group’s material and technical base will be destroyed and experienced troops and field commanders killed in the clashes. We’ve been already able to observe signs of this tendency since the failed al-Nusra attempt to dig in the Ramouseh Artillery Acandemy in southern Aleppo. 
The Kurdish YPG and the Ankara-led forces (Turkish-backed militant groups and the Turkish Armed Forces) have been competing in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo city. Both forces recently captured a bunch of villages from ISIS in the direction of Al-Bab. In this case, the ongoing coordination between the Syrian army and the YPG has once again become reality on the ground. The recent Kurdish operations were coordinated and supported by the Russian and Syrian military and military sources say that Moscow increased military supplies to the YPG in the area. Moscow and Domascus believe that the Kurdish buffer zone plays an important role, preventing Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki and other pro-Turkish groups from attacking the Syrian army and its allies in Aleppo city. In mid-October Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki officially announced that the next stage of Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield will include an advance on the ‘regime forces’ in Aleppo. 
Dozens of al-Nusra Front and linked-groups members were killed during their failed attempt to break the Syrian army’s defenses at the abandoned al-Mahjoorah Battalion military camp near the militant-controlled town of Ibtaa in the province of Daraa on October 31. According to pro-government forces over 40 militants were killed. Pro-militant media outlets confirm 26 killed in action terrorists.

7808.0,Jeffrey Sewell et al. : Metabiology face to face with Artificial Intelligence [VIDEO],"Randy Maugans & Jeffrey Sewell | Metabiology face to face with Artificial Intelligence Published on Sep 20, 2016 We are speaking on a subject that is vital for humanity to comprehend, AI or artificial intelligence, our objective is to further disclose how this is influencing humanity in subtle and not so subtle ways, for without knowledge of its existence or comprehension of its prevalence humanity is easily being led into more sophisticated technological control mechanisms. 
Jeffrey Sewell has spent many years in deep study of biology, in the process he introduces us to Metabiology, the tenants are simple, ‘As above, so below’ holds true from the nucleus of a cell to the furthest reaches of distant galaxies, life begets life. And it does so in a miraculous pattern that is reflected from the cosmos to the super organism, our Earth and to each of us in our divine vessel, the human body. From his website: http://cytocosmos.com 
“Metabiology is a study of the invisible systems of life spanning from the subatomic to the celestial. […] By using cell biology as a template, we are able to map elements within the cell to elements of unseen systems. The latter elements are obtained by cross referencing multiple sources of material from the OBE/LBL/NDE experiencer community. These so-called astral systems map quite nicely to systems in the cell, and they tell the same narrative, albeit the complexity and sophistication of cellular earth is many times that of the cell. 
Much of the understandings derived from such mappings are echoed in the deeper cosmologies and teachings of the ancient world religions. Examples include; Sumerian, Egyptian, Kabbalah, Gnostic, Kashmir Shivaism, and Vedanta. Jungian Psychology has also proven to be useful in mapping out the cellular psyche. 
This is the science of “as above, so below” in a very literal sense. The invisible is inner visible within the generalized cell itself. We can therefore grasp and ground the unseen systems of life by mapping them to the empirical biology of the cell. The implications of what this science has to offer reach all the way from psychology to cosmology and particle physics. 
The primary tenet of Metabiology is that we have inherited biology from systems of life that exist both above and before us. Should it be surprising? After all, we are children of the living universe. The Cytocosmos is a multidimensional living fractal, a cellular holarchy that has hitherto been called the universe.”

life spanning from the subatomic to the celestial  by using cell biology as a template we are able to map elements within the cell to elements of unseen systems the latter elements are obtained by cross referencing multiple sources of material from the obelblnde experiencer community these socalled astral systems map quite nicely to systems in the cell and they tell the same narrative albeit

6484.0,Why It’s Necessary To Relax Into A Stretch,"In a previous article , I discussed stretching—namely, why stretching is important for the masculine man, and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness. And while that advice is still valid, I neglected a very important concept in that first article: the techniques that detail how to stretch.
I am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical “stretching mindset,” but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately. But before I can discuss those, I have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use.
How Not To Stretch Many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch— avoid this at all costs ! First and foremost, as I have discussed previously in these pages, you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue. They evolved solely to “hold fast” and keep things in one piece, they should never be stretched at all!
The muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches, as they evolved to do. When stretching, your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.
Even when you are positioned properly, no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch, as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the “ anti-stretch reflex ” to prevent muscular tearing-stretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is, and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you’ll be risking muscle tears, and should normally be a heeded warning.
However, if you want to do advanced stretching (such as that nigh-impossible benchmark of fitness the splits), you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it, there is!

Relax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice—just ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex! Similarly, your anti-stretch reflex that keeps your “joints” (actually your muscles) stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.
The most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with (as usual, the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one), and that is the titular concept of “relaxing into a stretch”—with thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.
To use this technique, take an easy form of the stretch you want to do: using the splits as an example, you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle, and then…sit and wait.

Yes, paradoxically, relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch—in other words, you’re going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.
This is not something that happens quickly—from my experience, it will take 5-10 minutes per stretch, so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note, this is literally the only time where it’s acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise, in my opinion.
As you might expect, once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away, you can increase the stretch a little bit more, and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can’t go any further—this is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself, as I can’t judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.
This technique can be utilized for any stretch, and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However, there are other methods in the “Relax Into Stretch” family of exercises that can be utilized as well, such as meditation—mentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.
Or you can try “forced relaxation”, where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching, forcing the muscle to relax.

Either way you slice it, don’t just brute force your stretching, utilize these techniques for better results.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Leaving the European Union and losing access to the single market encourages Britain to develop trade with Russia and other non-EU states, Roger Munnings, the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce (RBCC) chairman, told Sputnik on Wednesday. ""There are at least two years to go before we leave the European Union, but I think the way Britain is looking at it is that it gives us a chance to be completely open to all countries in the world, including Russia. We’ll need to look for other trading partners rather than being confined to the European Union by virtue of the free trade arrangement, so we will be very keen to do trade with Russia,"" Munnings said on the sidelines of the RBCC RussiaTALK Investment Forum in Moscow.

9016.0,"2016 interview with Socrates: Another day of Life in the Empire! Are we near an endgame, or fools to ever ‘hope for change’? (6 of ?)","Posted on October 27, 2016 by Carl Herman 
“It is no use trying to escape their (Empire’s) arrogance by submission or good behavior. Robbers of the world, having by universal plunder exhausted the land, their drive is greed. If the enemy be rich, they are rapacious; if poor, they lust for domination. Neither rule of the East nor West can satisfy them. Alone among men, they crave with equal eagerness poverty and riches. To plunder, slaughter, seize with false pretenses, they give the lying name ‘empire.’ And where nothing remains but a desert, they call that ‘peace.’ ” – Tacitus, The Agricola and the Germania (analyses here , here ). Tacitus wrote ~ 100 AD, a century into empire. Emperors proclaimed to the public that their government still upheld the highest ideals of their Republic, claiming expanding empire was only and always in “self-defense.” 
“One Love! Let’s get together and feel all right. Hear the children cryin’ Hear the children cryin’ (One Heart! )” ~ Bob Marley, One Love 
language warning: Socrates and I speak in the same direct language that caused his execution for “corrupting the young.” 
Socrates: Carl! 
Carl: Soc! (bro hug) 
S: How may I be of service? (genuine smile) 
C: I just want to talk with an honest person, bro. We last talked 6 months ago . I don’t know if I have anything new to say, but I want to talk with someone who can hear. 
S: I’ll try. What about? 
C: We’re finishing a so-called “election” season that’s “jumped the shark” (and here ) with the Left-wing candidate a proven criminal, and Right-wing candidate a depraved Roman Emperor wanna-be . These are Left and Right arms of one illegal rogue state US empire , of course. 
S: Of course. 
C: So I keep feeling that we have to be near an endgame, Soc. We have to be, given the open floodgates of evidence about s much criminal activity by the .01% centered in war , looting , and lying . 
I mean, really, how much longer can this go on?! 
S: (smiling) Are you asking me, or just pausing for dramatic effect? 
C: I’m asking if you have any answers. 
S: (shrugs) I went through a 27-year civil war after almost 50 years of Athenian “leaders” concentrating an empire under their dominion. As we discussed in some detail , Athen’s “love of freedom” and spin that foreign barbarians “hate us for our freedoms” was total inversion of the facts because “freedom” was only meant for us, and not anyone else. Everyone else had to pay tribute or face military invasion. 
This hypocrisy in my time produced civil war. Those of us voicing the facts were insufficient to prevent it, or stop it once started. (Pauses to look intensely into my eyes) 
So you tell me: how much longer could your struggle go on? 
C: Fuck. 
I really don’t want a civil war. 
S: Fuck, indeed. If it comes, maybe you’ll be lucky. Maybe it won’t last 27 years. 
C: Fuck. 
S: But I do have a brighter perspective. I mean, how many of the non-sheeple would care to talk with me if all I ever did is leave them discouraged? (chuckles) Who would converse with Socrates if those who did were asked, ‘Hey, how did your conversation with Socrates go?’ and the responses were all disheartened, ‘Fuck!’ (laughs) 
C: Alright, go. What’s the higher light? 
S: You already know it. You tell me. 
C: Ok, you’re right. Maybe my being on Earth is all about growth, truth, and service, and I have to exercise real-world Faith to the One Life. It’s my job as a guest on this planet to harmonize in service to the Goddess ’ plan for Earth. Those of us who are relative beacons of light are isolated by design, obviously, by the facts of our relative leadership and lack of response from the public. 
(smile) At least I haven’t been voted by my peers for execution, as you were, Soc, for standing for truth. 
S: Not yet, anyway. If you had taken other pathways, you would have been assassinated by your oligarchs, such as Martin King , President Kennedy , and others . 
C: (sigh) I guess I don’t really have anything new to discuss. I just want to win this game. End the empire. Have truth and love. 
It’s been a long war, bro. 
S: Indeed it has. Longer than you know. 
C: So much bullshit . 
S: Only bullshit. Any truth has been co-opted, controlled, and used to mask the empire. The only reason I’m allowed onto your history pages is pretense that humanity lives on a planet operated from ideals of virtue. 
It’s the same with religious ideals of love. 
C: I’m ready to win. 
S: So was I. 
C: (sigh) Alright. So another day in the empire. Ok. Fine. Real-world exercise of Faith. The Goddess has more evolution to oversee with love and wisdom before we see a breakthrough. I can embrace that. 
It’s really stupid to argue with reality. 
Really stupid. 
S: (smiling) Apparently, yes. 
We have to work with what we have, assuredly. There is no other option. 
C: We discussed in our previous conversations linked for readers below that the US today compares to your empire in Athens, and the case that perhaps, just maybe, the US is on the verge of breakthrough for Truth and Love. 
S: Perhaps my history can allow perspective on your world of the present, and encourage Americans today to best use their voice and virtue for a brighter path than the civil war we endured. 
Certainly for all interested, this consideration is worthy of investing time and attention. History is literally all we know, and what drives our understanding of the present. History is what informs our direction for building the future. 
America’s history is at war between an awakening We the People and a deeply evil .01% committed to undisclosed vicious empire. 
Your history could devolve into civil war. (chuckles) As would-be Emperor Trump might say: “Sad.” 
C: (shaking my head, slight smile). Ok, I gotta’ go to work. Another day in the empire. My vote still stands to planetary management for full fucking truth in a breakthrough. I like a potential trend with revealing e-mails, but want a breakthrough that causes arrests of our .01% leaders in elegant endgame. 
S: Yes, and I’d like to fly, breath underwater swimming like a dolphin, and have daily dinner parties with wine, music and women! 
C: (mock agreement) Me, too! 
Ok, our wants aren’t our best guides, necessarily. 
I do have to go to work. Back to “earning a living.” 
S: Make the most of it. It’s your given area of self-expression. 
C: I promise. I’ll lead by example of my best good-faith expression and experience of virtue. 
Another day. 
S: Perhaps just another day. Perhaps you can’t imagine what’s coming. 
C: Human limitations. I’ll work with what I see. 
S: That’s all I concluded was possible. That’s all I got for wisdom. I didn’t teach anything other than look for yourself what’s right there in front of you to see. Listen to your small voice within for your best call of virtue. 
Step-by-step, my brother. In all empathy, live your Faith that you’re loved and guided more than you’re able to imagine. 
(bro hug) 
We’ll do our best.

civil war after almost  years of athenian leaders concentrating an empire under their dominion as we discussed in some detail  athens love of freedom and spin that foreign barbarians hate us for our freedoms was total inversion of the facts because freedom was only meant for us and not anyone else everyone else had to pay tribute or face military invasion this hypocrisy in my time produced civil war those of us voicing the facts were insufficient to prevent it or stop it once started pauses to look intensely into my eyes so you tell me how much longer could your struggle go on c fuck i really

8983.0,First Ever Hindu Woman Elected into Congress,"First ever Hindu was elected to the US House of Representatives. She will take the oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita. 

During election, Hawaii elected Japan-born Mazie Hirono to be the first ever Asian-American woman elected to the Senate. Hawaii also elected Democrat Tulsi Gabbard as the first ever practicing Hindu to the US House of Representatives. Because of this, Fox News have declare Hawaii a “disaster zone”. 

Gabbard is the daughter of two conservative Hawaii politicians. She first ran, and was elected into office at the age of 21. After her first term, she served on a 12 month tour of duty with Hawaii’s National Guard, and then became the first woman in history of the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy to be designated a “distinguished honor graduate”. 

She was then deployed to Baghdad as a medical operations specialist in 2004, and she was deployed to Kuwait in 2008. 

History has proven that not everyone is comfortable with a Hindu elect. When Hindu statesman Rajan Zed was asked by the Senate to open with a prayer in 2007, the American Family Association called the prayer “gross idolatry” and urged people to protest. Three protesters interrupted the prayer with shouts from the gallery. 

When she is sworn this January, Gabbard will take her oath of office over the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text for Hinduism or Sanatana Dharma. 

Gabbard hopes to assist the US in fostering a better relationship with India, the world’s largest democracy with a growing economic and nuclear power. She also hopes to work on veteran’s affairs, and environmental issues. 

Other non-Christian people in Congress include Minnesota’s Keith Ellison, who took his oath of office over the Qu-ran.

8965.0,Donald Groped Hillary in 2005! Trump and Weiner Sext Each Other!,"Topics: anthony weiner , presidential politics , American Politics , Donald J. Trump , Groping , Clinton's emails Friday, 4 November 2016 
[ Associated Press, Washington, D.C. ] FBI Director James Comey informed members of Congress this morning that he was expanding his investigation into e-mails, based on materials found on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
The materials include an e-mail from Trump to ""Carlos Danger,"" the on-line pseudonym which Weiner used, in which Trump bragged about groping then-Senator Clinton when she and former President Bill Clinton attended Trump's third wedding, to Melania Trump, at the billionaire's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2005. 
""There she was, her and Bill, smiling for the cameras, and all the time I had my hand on her ass,"" boasted Trump, according to Comey. 
Comey went on to state that Weiner's laptop contained ""sext"" messages from Weiner to Trump, containing photos of a bulge in the former Congressman's tidy whiteys, and messages back from Trump to Weiner, containing photos showing Trump's tiny hands gripping a large zucchini. 
Comey added that he, also, would be a subject of the ever-expanding investigation, because there were several selfies of himself on the laptop, including one in which he is posed sitting naked on a white horse with a garland of laurel on his brow, one of him dressed up to look like J.

That's quite an endorsement . And if there's anything top FBI officials now, it's crime families. Certainly this is probably the first serious level of experience that Hillary can claim in any field. 
“The Clintons, that’s a crime family, basically,” former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom said. “It’s like organized crime. I mean the Clinton Foundation is a cesspool.” 
“Kallstrom, best known for leading the investigation into the explosion of TWA flight 800 in the late '90s, said that Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, was a “pathological liar.” 
He also blasted Attorney General Loretta Lynch, claiming that she impeded the investigation into Clinton’s private server. 
“The problem here is this investigation was never a real investigation,” he said. “That’s the problem. They never had a grand jury empanelled, and the reason they never had a grand jury empanelled, I’m sure, is Loretta Lynch would not go along with that.” 
Kallstrom also said that FBI Director James Comey and the rest of the FBI’s leadership were responsible for holding back the investigation, not the rest of the bureau. 
“The agents are furious with what’s going on, I know that for a fact,” he said.

9757.0,Hillary Wants Aggressively Interventionist Foreign Policy,"10-27-1 6 The first Bill and Hillary Clinton co-presidency included eight years of Balkan and other wars of aggression. Bush/Cheney exceeded their lawlessness. Obama outdid the worst of both previous administrations - attacking seven countries, destabilizing others, orchestrating coups in Honduras, Paraguay and Brazil, threatening Venezuelan democracy, enforcing puppet rule in Haiti, continuing Plan Colombia aid, responsible for massacres, disappearances and torture of regime opponents, along with instituting increasingly anti-Sino/Russia policies, risking confrontation with both countries. On October 27, the Wall Street Journal said 2016 electoral politics scrambled traditional positions on foreign policy and international intervention, obliterating many of the usual partisan distinctions and presenting political challenges for whoever wins in November. Hillary will likely exceed the worst of Obamas aggressiveness on the international stage, according to her public statements and (what) top aides say. Shell be more hardline on Russia, China and Iran, risking direct confrontation. Earlier she said I think Ive been very clear that my position is in favor of what I called smart power that uses all the tools at our disposal, and military power always should be a last resort. Her views as first lady, US senator and secretary of state show how often she favors it aggressively, her rage for wars insatiable. As president and commander-in-chief, shell likely circumvent international and constitutional law like her predecessors, waging war on any nation she chooses. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell, a likely Hillary administration appointee, urges a more muscular US geopolitical role, including new sanctions on Russia and Iran, earlier saying: Ships leave Iran on a regular basis carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen. I would have no problem from a policy perspective of having the US Navy boarding their ships and if there are weapons on them to turn those ships around. This type aggressiveness would risk greater Middle East war than already, maybe involving Russia and China, challenging US interventionism - knowing their nations are next if its not stopped. Earlier, Hillarys top national security advisor Jake Sullivan said (w)e need to be raising the costs to Iran for its destabilizing behavior, and we need to be raising the confidence of our Sunni partners. Last years nuclear deal failed to change overall US policy toward Iran - wanting pro-Western puppet governance replacing its sovereign independence. Instead of cooperating with Iran in furthering regional peace and stability, a Hillary administration appears planning to challenge it confrontationally - perhaps with another war in mind, a far greater challenge than against other Middle East states, especially with Russia likely to intervene if asked.

1967.0,Both parties want to craft populist messages for 2016,"Presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing: Economic mobility, and the feeling of many Americans that they are being shut out from the nation’s prosperity, will be a defining theme of the 2016 campaign.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush last week became the latest Republican to signal a readiness to engage Democrats on what historically has been their turf, putting issues of middle-class wage stagnation, poverty and shared prosperity at the forefront of their political messages.

Bush’s framing of the economic and social challenges facing the country nearly mirrors that of likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as other possible contenders on the left. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has written a book on the subject, “American Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,” to be published this week, while Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has proposed policies for distressed communities that he sees as “the ticket to the middle class.”

And Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee who was portrayed by Democrats as insensitive to and out of touch with the lives of middle- and working-class Americans, has told friends he considers poverty a topic du jour as he weighs another run in 2016.

“You talk to any pollster, on the Democratic side or the Republican side, they’re in complete agreement on the idea that there has to be an economic populist message,” said Matthew Dowd, a top strategist for former president George W. Bush’s 2000 and 2004 campaigns. “Then it comes down to ‘Are there credible solutions and is there a credible candidate?’ ”

About 45 million Americans live at or below the poverty line, according to last fall’s census estimates, while the median household income in the United States in 2013 was just under $52,000. Adjusted for inflation, the median is 8 percent lower than it was in 2007, the last full year before the recession, and 11 percent below what it was in 2000.

Wage stagnation has been a persistent problem for low- and middle-income workers. “Since the late 1970s, wages for the bottom 70 percent of earners have been essentially stagnant, and between 2009 and 2013, real ­wages fell for the entire bottom 90 percent of the wage distribution,” Lawrence Mishel of the liberal Economic Policy Institute wrote in a paper published this month.

Launching his new political action committee, Right to Rise, Jeb Bush asserted last week in the PAC’s mission statement that President Obama’s tenure has been “pretty good” for those at the top of the income scale but a “lost decade” for everyone else.

“Millions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the American Dream is now out of their reach; that our politics are petty and broken; that opportunities are elusive; and that the playing field is no longer fair or level,” Bush wrote. “Too many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp.”

Bush’s focus adds an unexpected element to the coming debate and puts pressure on the entire field, himself included, to come forward with fresh policies that address the nation’s core economic problems.

The shift also highlights a potential vulnerability for Democrats. In his campaigns, Obama twice promised to focus on wealth inequality and middle-class stagnation, but those problems persist even as the economy revs up and unemployment falls.

Clinton could be challenged now from both the right and the left to lay out solutions that go beyond Obama’s — and also to develop a political voice of her own to articulate them. Democrats conceded after last fall’s midterm elections that they had not found a compelling economic message.

Democrats will look to Clinton, should she run, to take the lead in doing that — although they also are looking to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her harder-edged populist rhetoric.

Clinton tested such a message last year. In a major speech at the New America Foundation in May, she said that Americans are “finding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy. The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach.”

The language of Bush, Rubio and other Republicans appears aimed at avoiding the problem that bedeviled Romney throughout his 2012 campaign. The former Massachusetts governor’s memorable comment about the “47 percent” of the population who he said depend on government and feel like victims haunted him during the final months before the election.

Yuval Levin, editor of the conservative journal National Affairs, said the overall shift in emphasis by Republicans is an effort to move away from Romney’s more abstract message of job growth and to focus more specifically on social mobility and solutions for those at or near the bottom.

“It’s a process of letting the light out from under the bushel,” Levin said. Citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare, he added: “I think Republican ideas have always held this promise, but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements. . . . A difference in emphasis is not insignificant.”

Democrats, however, argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for Republicans — especially if Jeb Bush becomes the GOP nominee — to gloss over former president George W. Bush’s legacy, which Democrats say tightened the middle-class squeeze.

“It’s not like the Republican Party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to Clinton on economic policy. “It’s a weird thing to say, ‘I care about how the rest of the country is doing, not just the top earners,’ when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your party’s economic position starts with undoing Dodd-Frank,” the 2010 law that tightened regulation of Wall Street.

Obama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency, from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014. Still, many Democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middle-class insecurities.

That is where Bush and some other Republicans are taking aim. Two factors have contributed to the opening they see.

One is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and non-rich. The other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class, and that the risk of some born into the middle class — particularly minorities — falling out of it is growing.

Democrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middle-class economic issues. Republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution. Could that be changing?

“How do you tell the middle class, ‘We’re your guy?’ ” said Grover Norquist, a conservative anti-tax advocate. “Republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys they’re running against are sufficiently discredited.”

William Galston of the Brookings Institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one Republicans will feel more comfortable engaging — and on their own terms. “That’s what Jeb Bush is saying: ‘We can accept a definition of a problem . . . but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges,’ ” he said.

But Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said Bush’s framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet.

“I would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility,” he said. “That will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank.”

Other Republicans have been working to reorient their party toward blue-collar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas. Former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016, long have talked about the GOP’s need to recognize the problems of working families.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty. In 2012, as Romney’s running mate, Ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment. He was frustrated that Romney’s campaign team directed him to talk about other topics.

Rubio has proposed a fundamental shift in anti-poverty programs. He has suggested devolving power and responsibility from Washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a “flex fund.” The senator from Florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs. On education, he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs. Rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earned-income tax credit to extend its reach to more people.

Democrats are skeptical that Republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government.

“It sounds to me like a ­traditional Romney Republican ­trickle-down agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility,” said Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Biden who works at the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.

Democrats say it’s too early to draw conclusions, but they note that if Bush and other Republicans find new ways to engage middle-class voters with populist themes, the pressures on Clinton will mount significantly.

“Voters are going to [say], ‘Okay, thank you for acknowledging this problem, but what are you going to do about it?’ ” Bernstein said. “I would argue that Democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than [raising the] minimum wage and universal pre-K.”",REAL,presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing economic mobility and the feeling of many americans that

his presidency from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of  still many democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middleclass insecurities that is where bush and some other republicans are taking aim two factors have contributed to the opening they see one is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and nonrich the other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class and that the risk of some born into the middle class  particularly minorities  falling out of it is growing democrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middleclass economic issues republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution could that be changing how do you tell the middle class were your guy  said grover norquist a conservative antitax advocate republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys theyre running against are sufficiently discredited william galston of the brookings institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one republicans will feel more comfortable engaging  and on their own terms thats what jeb bush is saying we can accept a definition of a problem    but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges  he said but galston a former domestic policy adviser to president bill clinton said bushs framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet i would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility he said that will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank other republicans have been working to reorient their party toward bluecollar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas former senator rick santorum of pennsylvania and former arkansas governor mike huckabee two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in  long have talked about the gops need to recognize the problems of working families house ways and means committee chairman paul ryan rwis has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty in  as romneys running mate ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment he was frustrated that romneys campaign team directed him to talk about other topics rubio has proposed a fundamental shift in antipoverty programs he has suggested devolving power and responsibility from washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a flex fund the senator from florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs on education he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earnedincome tax credit to extend its reach to more people democrats are skeptical that republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government it sounds to me like a traditional romney republican trickledown agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility said jared bernstein a former adviser to vice president biden who works at the center of budget and policy priorities democrats say its too early to draw conclusions but they note that if bush and other republicans find new ways to engage middleclass voters with populist themes the pressures on clinton will mount significantly voters are going to say okay thank you for acknowledging this problem but what are you going to do about it  bernstein said i would argue that democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than raising the minimum wage and universal prek,"['presidential', 'hopefuls', 'parties', 'agree', 'least', 'one', 'thing', 'economic', 'mobility', 'feeling', 'many', 'americans',

431.0,First Take: Wall Street bids goodbye to June hike,"NEW YORK -- Bye bye June rate hike. That was the billboard-size headline from Wall Street trading desks after the U.S. job-creation machine hit the wall in May. The government said 38,000 jobs were created in May, way, way, way  below the roughly 160,000 new positions Wall Street economists had been expecting.

It was the worst month for job creation since September 2010.

The Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve had been driving home the message that it was ""appropriate"" to hike interest rates in coming months – and perhaps as early as June – IF the job market and economy continued to perform well and meet their more upbeat forecast.

But the May jobs report was bad. Really bad.

""Horrible,"" is the word used by Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at MSUSA. ""Very weak,"" chimed in Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, tweeted out that the lousy jobs number amounted to a  ""bombshell.""

A bombshell, indeed. So weak was the 38,000 May job count, that Wall Street now sees virtually a zero chance of the Fed moving at its June meeting, which breaks up on June 15.

""This is the weakest number of workers added in almost six years,"" Gaffney told USA TODAY via e-mail.

After the dreadful jobs report was released, the odds of a June hike plunged to about 4%, down sharply from 19% before the data were released, according to futures markets tracked by the CME Group.

""Just when they thought it was safe to go back into the water,"" the Fed gets hit with this less-than-stellar data point on jobs, Ricchiuto told clients in a report. ""This now assures that June is off the table, but may not rule out July.""

But professional investors are still not willing to rule out a hike in July – at least not yet as there is a lot of economic data to come between now and July. The chances of a July hike plunged to 34% from close to 60%.

The market reaction was swift. Stocks dipped as investors now have to worry about a possible slowdown in job creation, which is a negative for the economy. ""Risks about the strength of the U.S. economy outweigh the positive impacts of lower interest rates,"" Gaffney said.

Bond yields fell, as investors piled back into U.S. government bonds as the threat of an imminent Fed rate hike fade. The U.S. dollar weakened as the Fed's rate-hike timetable gets pushed back.

Sure the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7%. But while that number sounds good it is mainly due to ""another big drop in the labor force,"" says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.

Yellen is scheduled to speak on Monday, Ashworth adds. Wall Street will be listening – closely.

""Yellen should provide more insight on the Fed's thinking Monday,"" he said via e-mail.",REAL,new york  bye bye june rate hike that was the billboardsize headline from wall street trading desks after

Powerful video shows a homeless woman protecting Donald Trump’s Walk of Fame Star after it was smashed by a criminal leftist. 
As The Gateway Pundit reports , the woman was seen holding up a sign reading: “20 Million Illegals and Americans Sleep on the Streets in Tents. Vote Trump.” 
It was repaired on the same day. 
The day after, this homeless Trump supporter went to protect it. 
“I’m gonna stay here and watch this, and make sure nobody touches it,” she was heard saying. Homeless Trump supporter guards @realDonaldTrump 's star on Hollywood Blvd. against all SJWs #BasedSentinel #MAGA3X https://t.co/BjGcFO0du5 ? pic.twitter.com/nrMqnbW5UK

Video shared on Periscope shows hordes of disgusting leftists insult and attack the woman for supporting Trump. 
In this short video posted to YouTube, one angry black man is seen screaming in her face and asking her: “Do you know your federal government is not even party of the f***ing government?” 
“Do you know that?” he asks. “No, I didn’t think so,” he says. 
“Hello,” another woman in the crowd shouts in agreement. “Open your eyes,” she says. 
In case anyone is not aware, the federal government is part of the government.

5224.0,"With 3:20 a.m. tweet storm Saturday, Clinton continues to mock Trump’s Friday ‘meltdown’","WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. — Not to be outdone by her Republican rival, Hillary Clinton fired off a series of early-morning messages Saturday  on Twitter.

Only the tweets sent over the Democratic presidential nominee’s account dealt with a very different subject matter than those blasted about a former beauty-pageant winner by Donald Trump 24 hours before.

[Trump under fire after sending nasty tweets about ‘disgusting’ ex-Miss Universe]

Clinton instead focused on national service, a subject to which she had devoted a speech in Florida on Friday.

“It's 3:20am. As good a time as any to tweet about national service,” said the first one, coming at the same time that Trump started his storm of disparaging tweets about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.

The next Clinton tweet borrowed a favorite word of Trump.

“There are hundreds of thousands more @AmeriCorps applications than spots. Horrible!” it read. “Let's expand it from 75,000 annual members to 250,000.”

The tweets — several more followed — were the latest bid by Clinton to keep a spotlight on what she described Friday as Trump coming “unhinged.”

In his tweets, the Republican presidential nominee called Machado “disgusting” and a “con” and raised questions about her past, alleging she had been in a sex tape.

The former Miss Universe’s story has dominated media coverage of the election since Clinton brought her up at Monday’s debate, when she criticized Trump for denigrating comments he made in 1996 about Machado’s weight.

Unlike Trump, who often tweets himself, many of those sent out over Clinton’s official campaign account are composed by aides.

On Friday, there were a series mocking Trump’s behavior, and at a rally in Coral Springs, Fla., she accused her rival of having a “meltdown.”

7793.0,220 ‘Significant’ Pipeline Spills Already This Year Exposes Troubling Safety Record,"By Dan Zukowski
Three major U.S. pipeline spills within the last month are just a small part of the 220 significant incidents reported so far this year—and 3,032 since 2006—that provide a stark reminder of the environmental hazards of an aging pipeline infrastructure carrying fossil fuels. The costs of these leaks since 2006 has amounted to $4.7 billion.
1. Oklahoma: On Oct. 24, the 30-inch S-1 pipeline carrying crude oil from the critical Cushing, Oklahoma hub to refineries and chemical plants on the Gulf Coast began to leak and was shut down overnight. It was the second release connected with the Cushing storage facility in less than a month.
2. Pennsylvania: On Oct. 21, 55,000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a ruptured Sunoco Logistics pipeline in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, just upstream from the Susquehanna River. Carol Parenzan, Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper , said that witnesses who contacted her office reported that the “smell of petroleum is so thick you can taste it.” The 80-year old pipeline was damaged by a heavy storm that dumped seven inches of rain on the area.
3. Alabama: Last month, the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama leaked an estimated 336,000 gallons of gasoline and triggered concerns about gas shortages for drivers in the East. That spill was Colonial’s fifth in the state this year and occurred on a 43-year old section of the pipeline.
Based on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of significant pipeline incidents grew 26.8 percent from 2006 to 2015. A significant incident is defined as one that results in serious injury or fatality, costs more than $50,000, releases more than five barrels of volatile fluids such as gasoline or 50 barrels of other liquids, or results in a fire or explosion. In 2015, there were 326 such incidents—almost one per day.
Some 55 percent of the U.S. network of 135,000 miles of pipeline is more than 45 years old. Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable, even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way “to insure safe operations.” But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are “about as successful as a random member of the public” finding a leak. Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters, only 22 percent, or 105, were detected by advanced detection systems. The others were found in different ways, with the public finding 99 of the leaks.
In testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year, Carl Weimer, executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust , said, “Under the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country.” Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulations.
“It is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure, but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality,” said Parenzan.

2777.0,Obama makes the right call to tough it out in Afghanistan,"The president now plans to continue a U.S. ground force presence in Afghanistan to help hold off the Taliban until he leaves office. This is an uncommon turnaround for a president who hasn’t changed his mind on foreign policy since drawing his (much-ballyhooed and promptly ignored) “red line” in Syria.

So what does this rare shift have to say about Obama’s foreign policy and America’s future role in Afghanistan? Not much.

Mr. Obama started his presidency hoping to use Afghanistan to demonstrate his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty in the national security business. He asserted that, unlike “Bush’s War” in Iraq, fighting in the place where the 9/11 attacks were concocted was worth it.

In approving a surge in Afghanistan, the president made much of his role as decider-in-chief. Yet, even as he sent in more troops, he tipped his hand that Afghanistan was not as much an exception to the talk-don’t-fight Obama Doctrine as the tough-guy image he sought to cultivate.

The president gave commanders only half the force and half the time they requested to do the job right. It turned out, the commanders were right.  Mr. Obama, however, had his eye on the next election and wanted to go into the race showing he had put the war on a glide-path to wind down and pull out.

Signaling a limited-time interest in fighting an enemy rarely ends well. The Taliban adopted the logical and predictable strategy of simply waiting out Mr. Obama. Also predictably, the half-measure surge and overly ambitious transfer of responsibility to the Afghan military resulted in unnecessarily heavy casualties for Afghan security forces, a persistent Taliban, and a shaky security situation.

Nevertheless, Afghanistan is far from a total failure. Indeed,  compared to the president’s other foreign policy dalliances—from the Russian “reset” to Libya to Syria to Iraq to Ukraine— it ranks as his best achievement yet.

Which is why Mr. Obama is reportedly backing away from his plan to yank virtually all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. Instead, he has agreed to leave the current force of 9,800 troops in place throughout “most” of next year, and keep 5,500 in theater thereafter.

It’s a good call. With the Taliban flexing its muscles anew and the Islamic State making inroads there, completely pulling out makes little sense. Mr. Obama can ill afford another complete foreign policy disaster on his watch.  Further, virtually everyone –the U.S. military, the Afghans, Pakistan, India, our NATO allies— wants the U.S. to stay and see the job through.

In addition, there is zero domestic pressure for the president to make good on his campaign promise. An appearance of Code Pink is about as common as a Yeti sighting. And in the debates thus far, presidential candidates have devoted about as much time to Afghanistan as they have to defunding Public Television.

It makes complete sense for Mr. Obama to tough it out in Afghanistan, but don’t expect the change in plans to make things better for the Afghans or the larger security picture. The U.S. presence is the bare minimum to hold on. More forces with loser rules of engagement would make the country much safer, much faster.

But holding on is probably the best we can hope for with this president.  Here’s hoping the next Commander in Chief’s attitude toward Afghanistan will focus more on solving problems than just wishing they would go away.

In a truly shocking twist the Suptreme Court decided the grown Iraqi man may not have realised the 10-year-old did not want to be sexually abused by him. 
Amir A, 20, was visiting the Theresienbad pool in the Austrian capital of Vienna last December as part of a trip to encourage integration. 
When the youngster went to the showers, Amir A. allegedly followed him, pushed him into a toilet cubicle, and violently sexually assaulted him. 
Following the attack, the accused rapist returned to the pool and was practising on the diving board when police arrived, after the 10-year-old raised the alarm with the lifeguard. 
The child suffered severe anal injuries which had to be treated at a local children’s hospital, and is still plagued by serious post-traumatic stress disorder. 
In a police interview, Amir A. confessed to the crime; telling officers the incident had been “a sexual emergency”, as his wife had remained in Iraq and he “had not had sex in four months”. 
A court found Amir guilty of serious sexual assault and rape of a minor, and sentenced him to six years in jail.

3027.0,American politics has reached peak polarization,"For a long time in American politics, we've been trapped in a cycle of ever-escalating political polarization. As measured by voting patterns in the US Congress, the two parties have pulled apart to distances we've never seen before. As measured by consistent partisan positioning among voters, the split in the electorate has reached a historic level of divisiveness.

But this is about to end. We've now hit peak polarization. The forces that have fueled the widening gap between the two political parties are now fueling fights within the two political parties, fights that will lead to new coalitions in American politics, eventually realigning the two parties. A new era of American politics is about to emerge.

The tautological reason polarization has increased in American politics is that over the past four decades, conflict in American politics has increasingly operated along a single dimension: Republican versus Democrat. A large number of issues that were once nonpartisan or non-ideological have become partisan issues. Almost every policy has now been swept into the maw of partisan jockeying, leaving almost no space for the cross-partisan cooperation our political system relies on to function.

In order for congressional polarization to persist, both parties have to maintain tight enough discipline over their members and the political agenda to ensure consistent party voting. And in order for public polarization to persist, parties have to maintain tight enough message discipline among their elites to ensure that their voters only hear one main message.

This is breaking down. Republicans are now in open warfare between Trump supporters and #NeverTrumpers. Democrats are far less divided, but internal rifts between their ""establishment"" (Hillary Clinton) and ""insurgent"" (Bernie Sanders) wings are also real and likely lasting.

This conflict is emerging on issues of international trade, on questions of corporate (especially Wall Street) power, and in growing anger over money in politics and corruption generally. In short, parties are increasingly divided on a growing range of issues that pit their less-educated, lower-income voters who feel left behind by the current political-economic system against their better-educated, higher-income voter who don't want to mess too much with the status quo. These conflicts are not going away anytime soon.

This moment is the culmination of four interconnected but ultimately unsustainable trends that have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades:

Close competition fueled partisan nastiness and increased the demand for campaign money. The demand for campaign money made the parties more dependent on wealthy donors, which made them less responsive to their voters. This lack of responsiveness provided plenty of evidence for corruption and the felt sense that politics was broken, which fueled anger. Both parties attempted to channel this anger against the other party to distract from their own failures and contradictions and win elections by rendering the other party toxic. This exacerbated the sense that politics was broken and corrupt.

These trends created contradictions, and now these contradictions have created openings. Ambitious candidates who could get past their parties' campaign finance gatekeepers had a lot of angry and left-behind voters eager for their message. And this is precisely what Sanders and especially Donald Trump have accomplished. Now there is no going back.

These are big claims. So let's flesh this story out a little more, this time with expanded detail.

The story could go all the way back to the decisive election of 1932, when Democrats became the dominant party in American politics for a generation, holding together a big-tent New Deal coalition that included Southern pro-segregationists with Northern urban progressives. But it was an uneasy alliance that could only last as long as civil rights legislation was bottled up. Then in 1964, the Democrats decidedly became the party of civil rights. And as Lyndon Johnson allegedly acknowledged upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Democrats ""have lost the South for a generation.""

Democrats had controlled the South ever since Republican-led Reconstruction (since Republicans were the party of Lincoln and of Reconstruction). But as Republicans came to be the party better aligned with the South on issues of race, conservative Republicans replaced conservative Democrats in Southern House and Senate seats, starting in the 1980s. By 1995, when Republicans won the House for the first time in 40 years, this transition was mostly complete. By 2011, it was absolute and total.

As this all happened, the ideological center of the Republican Party moved to the South, fusing social and economic conservatism. Northern liberal Republicans were marginalized and soon endangered. Democrats, meanwhile, lost their Southern, conservative wing, and the ideological center of the Democratic Party moved to the coasts and big cities, fusing social and economic liberalism.

As the parties became less internally diverse, individual members of Congress delegated more power to their party leaders. After all, they all now basically agreed on the issues. And they wanted leaders who could punish disloyal dissenters and control the agenda. So when Newt Gingrich took over the speakership in 1995, he centralized power in the position in a way it had not been centralized since 1910.

In the 1990s, American politics entered a somewhat unusual period of remarkably close two-party competition for control of the House and the Senate.

This, as political scientist Frances Lee explains, has been the catalyst for a very nasty brand of partisan fighting.

This seems exactly right to me, and there's lots of evidence to prove it.

But not only has this close competition fueled partisanship by turning legislating into zero-sum trench warfare, it has also turbocharged the fundraising dimension of political campaigning.

Parties are campaigning harder than ever to win over those swing seats, and this has meant raising ever-expanding sums of money. And in order to raise this money, both parties have had to lean more and more on their wealthiest donors.

But relying on these wealthy donors created a problem for both parties. On many issues, particularly economic issues, wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters.

Major Republican donors generally want fiscal austerity, and particularly a rolled-back welfare state. They also tend to be much more pro-immigration and pro–free trade than Republican voters, and not particularly worried about social issues. But schemes like privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare have never been all that popular with actual Republican voters. And as the middle classes' wages have stagnated, especially for those without college degrees, and the share of foreign-born residents in the US has reached levels not seen since the 1920s (it hit 13.9 percent in 2015), the voting constituency for anti-immigration populism has grown considerably.

Democratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal. But they are not about to support Sanders-style socialism. They prefer Clinton's generally pro-market views. They will tolerate some regulation of business, but not that much, particularly when it's the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in.

Whereas Democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote, by the 1990s unions could no longer provide the support Democrats needed. Democrats instead moved to depend on the ""professional class,"" deprioritizing workers' concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in Hollywood and San Francisco and Manhattan fundraisers.

For a while, both parties could manage these contradictions, being responsive to their donors while pooh-poohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone. And for much of the 1990s and 2000s, the economy was doing okay, which generally kept voters from feeling too angry. And to the extent that individual voters weren't benefiting, it was, of course, the other party's fault.

As long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side, and the economy was not in a major recession, party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters, and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging.

This negativity translated into what political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster call ""negative partisanship."" As they explain:

All these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades. But they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking, and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in Washington was because of the other party. This could not go on indefinitely.

In fall 2008 the financial crisis hit, and the government bailed out the big Wall Street banks in a very public way. For many, this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged: Washington and Wall Street were in a corrupt alliance, a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck. As the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery, economic insecurity and political resentment increased.

Obama and the Democrats swept the 2008 election on the strength of anti-Bush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change. For the first time since 1992, Democrats had unified control in Washington; Republicans were now out in the cold.

With their backs against the wall and Democrats as the new Washington establishment, Republicans now turned their anti-government rhetoric up to 11. Obama was Stalin. Obama was Hitler. Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim bent on destroying America. Democrats responded to the charges with signature big-government legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have government-subsidized health care. The Republican base went crazy. All their worst fears were confirmed.

In 2009, the Tea Party emerged, representing what felt like new anti-establishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of Republican anti-government rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing. In 2010, on the strength of Tea Party anti-Obama energy (and the fact that Democrats had won a bunch of majority Republican House districts in 2006 and 2008), Republicans swept back into control of the House. In the 2014 election, they finally won back the Senate.

But then nothing happened. Obamacare, the devil piñata of every Republican attack, was neither repealed nor replaced. Worse, Republican leaders were negotiating with Obama, Satan himself. They were letting Obama get away with an executive order on immigration. Here was the most corrupt, most crony capitalist administration in history, and what were Republicans in Congress doing? They were rolling over and being just as corrupt!

In June 2015, Donald Trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive anti-immigration stance. Because he had his own money and his own media celebrity, Trump did not need to do the pro-austerity, pro-immigration, pro-free trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor GOP money tree. He could just run for president, declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didn't have a super PAC. And he could speak to the working-class Republican voters who had been left behind in this economy, by saying he'd go after China and give them Social Security and Medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund rip-off artists.

And they loved it. For decades, they had been told, for partisan reasons, to be angry; they had been told, for partisan reasons, that Washington was corrupt, and that all Washington politicians were evil. Now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins. They also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the ""corrupt"" things Republican establishment types themselves were doing.

A few months later, in September, Republican Speaker John Boehner announced he would resign from Congress, responding to efforts by the House Freedom Caucus to force him out. This was the first time since 1910 that an insurgent faction in the House had successfully challenged a sitting speaker. The anti-establishment anger that Republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders.

On the Democratic side, anti-Clinton progressives were hoping to draft Elizabeth Warren, who had demonstrated her anti-establishment bona fides in December 2014, sinking Obama's appointment of Wall Street banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury position (Weiss withdrew his nomination, instead accepting a counselor position to Secretary Jack Lew). Warren had also been a prominent opponent of Obama's major Asian free trade agreement.

But Warren didn't run. Instead, it was self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders who found the opening. Democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for Hillary. This meant Sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative, attention that he was able to snowball into a following. Sanders won't win the nomination. But he has done far, far better than anybody ever expected, because a sizable number of Democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win. And like Sanders, they are sick and tired of it.

If you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time, you'll see a previous peak around 1910 or so. While historical analogies are never perfect, there are some notable similarities between now and around 1910.

For one, 1910 was the last time a sitting speaker of the US House had been effectively challenged from within the party. Second, in 1912 the Republican Party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered, with about half of Republicans supporting Howard Taft (the incumbent) and about half supporting Teddy Roosevelt (the previous incumbent). Democrat Woodrow Wilson won in a landslide.

Around 1910 was also when the last great anti-establishment movement in America, the progressive movement, emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power, concentrations that many Americans felt had left them behind. As political scientist Grant McConnell once wrote of ""the progressive legacy,"" it consisted of a ""charges made against virtually all the institutions of American society"" with ""one common theme — corruption. ... Corruption of such prevalence, disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slow-spreading decay. The theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation."" This resonates with today's anti-establishment mood.

Political scientist Hans Noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement ""crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them."" Noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures, both economically (e.g., the ""trusts"") and politically (they disliked political parties and other authority structures).

In 1910, it was progressive Republican George Norris who led the internal House revolt against Speaker Joe Cannon, stripping Cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members, who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization. Like John Boehner in 2015, Cannon in 1910 represented the culmination of exactly 20 years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the House speakership. Just as Gingrich had radically centralized control in 1995, Speaker Thomas Reed had radically centralized control in 1890.

Parties depolarized in the 1910s and 1920s because, freed of centralized leadership structures, more legislating happened in committees, where a cross-cutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties. Interestingly, trade policy also became much less polarized in the 1920s, with cross-party coalitions on tariff issues.

Most likely, Trump will be the Republican nominee. Even if the #NeverTrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him (unlikely, but possible), the anti-establishment forces in the Republican Party are not going away. If not Trump (though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer), somebody in the Tea Party, or possibly even Ted Cruz, will find a way to harness the Trump voters by following the Trump issues playbook. Where there are voters to be had, there are politicians to have them.

Meanwhile, in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process. No matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics, it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that Boehner failed to resolve, which means he will have to eventually lean on Democrats to pass a budget and, like Boehner before him, alienate some of his party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, much less beloved even within his party, will face similar problems.

Most likely, Hillary Clinton will become the 45th US president (she has led in every single head-to-head poll against Trump). And most likely she will use her agenda-setting powers to try to force the Republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them, especially immigration and trade. Clinton's natural home is in the pro-business center, a position that will be advantageous to her and Democrats in the short term at least. But she has to be cautious. Emboldened by Sanders and by Elizabeth Warren, the progressive wing of the Democrats is growing, and will be unhappy with Clinton's pro-business instincts.

The internal fights will continue in both parties. The competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true Republicans/Democrats. The growing importance of outside, non-party groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties. Party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups, but they'd be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas. After all, the party that does best in American politics is always the one that can build the broadest coalition, which means accepting ideological diversity.

Eventually, congressional leaders will realize (or be forced to realize) that the only leadership style that works is a less centralized, more committee-driven approach. This is the only way ideologically heterogeneous parties can effectively govern. A more decentralized Congress, with more fluid coalitions, will function better, assuming that a more committee-driven process is also accompanied by increases in congressional staffing capacity. Partisan control of Congress will mean less, since there will be more cross-party coalitions.

Many issues, like gun rights or affirmative action, will remain very partisan. But other issues, especially those of corporate/Wall Street power, antitrust, interventionist foreign policy, will likely split the parties. Trump Republicans and Sanders Democrats will find common cause against establishment centrists. Big organized interests, like the Chamber of Commerce and other corporate groups, will align less closely with Republicans, realizing that their future success will require the right mix of Republicans and Democrats to advance their agendas.

And as the parties become more ideological diverse, voters, who are generally more ideologically all over the place than the current party alignment would suggest, will identify less reliably with one or the other, since there will be more for them in both parties. They will again sometimes split their tickets, depending on who is running. Many will feel more passionate about individual issues and will align themselves with supporters of those issues in both parties, especially as individual interest groups become cross-partisan in order to achieve policy outcomes. In that respect, politics will come to look more like it did in the 1950s and 1970s, when liberal Republicans existed alongside conservative Democrats.

This is an optimistic scenario.

But it only works if party leaders tolerate diversity within their party and allow disagreements.

Another scenario is that establishment Republicans banish the Trump faction and Democrats banish the Sanders faction after the 2016 elections, and both parties go back to the predictable and intractable trench warfare battle lines that have become increasingly dug in over the past two decades, using nastier and nastier tactics to subvert internal divisions in service of the larger fight against a common enemy. This may be possible for a little while longer (especially if the economy improves significantly), but it is still probably long-term unsustainable for reasons I've described above. It also may mean that 2020 becomes an even more violent and nasty election.

Another possibility is that the parties realign quickly, with the Trump/Tea Party faction effecting a rapid transformation of the Republican Party into a downscale nationalist populist party, pushing the remaining upper-class moderate Republicans into a more pro-business Democratic Party, which in turn pushes some disaffected Sanders voters into the Republican Party. If this realignment happens too quickly, there is no period of depolarization. But this seems unlikely, given the stickiness of partisan identity and the strong disagreements between the two parties on a whole range of other issues.

Other scenarios are possible as well, especially if there are significant global crises.

But here's the bottom line: Something is different this year in American politics. The logic that has operated for the past two decades or so is breaking down, largely because the factors and trends that propelled it produced unsustainable contradictions. American politics is now entering a new logic, with new trends and forces that will push the lines of political conflict in directions we are only beginning to understand.

This feels like chaos, and it is. But it is also good news, because chaos scrambles the rules. We've hit peak polarization. Politics is slowly coming unstuck. A period of new possibilities awaits.

donors created a problem for both parties on many issues particularly economic issues wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters major republican donors generally want fiscal austerity and particularly a rolledback welfare state they also tend to be much more proimmigration and profree trade than republican voters and not particularly worried about social issues but schemes like privatizing social security and voucherizing medicare have never been all that popular with actual republican voters and as the middle classes wages have stagnated especially for those without college degrees and the share of foreignborn residents in the us has reached levels not seen since the s it hit  percent in  the voting constituency for antiimmigration populism has grown considerably democratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal but they are not about to support sandersstyle socialism they prefer clintons generally promarket views they will tolerate some regulation of business but not that much particularly when its the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in whereas democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote by the s unions could no longer provide the support democrats needed democrats instead moved to depend on the professional class deprioritizing workers concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in hollywood and san francisco and manhattan fundraisers for a while both parties could manage these contradictions being responsive to their donors while poohpoohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone and for much of the s and s the economy was doing okay which generally kept voters from feeling too angry and to the extent that individual voters werent benefiting it was of course the other partys fault as long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side and the economy was not in a major recession party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging this negativity translated into what political scientists alan abramowitz and steven webster call negative partisanship as they explain all these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades but they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in washington was because of the other party this could not go on indefinitely in fall  the financial crisis hit and the government bailed out the big wall street banks in a very public way for many this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged washington and wall street were in a corrupt alliance a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck as the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery economic insecurity and political resentment increased obama and the democrats swept the  election on the strength of antibush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change for the first time since  democrats had unified control in washington republicans were now out in the cold with their backs against the wall and democrats as the new washington establishment republicans now turned their antigovernment rhetoric up to  obama was stalin obama was hitler obama was a kenyanborn muslim bent on destroying america democrats responded to the charges with signature biggovernment legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have governmentsubsidized health care the republican base went crazy all their worst fears were confirmed in  the tea party emerged representing what felt like new antiestablishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of republican antigovernment rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing in  on the strength of tea party antiobama energy and the fact that democrats had won a bunch of majority republican house districts in  and  republicans swept back into control of the house in the  election they finally won back the senate but then nothing happened obamacare the devil piata of every republican attack was neither repealed nor replaced worse republican leaders were negotiating with obama satan himself they were letting obama get away with an executive order on immigration here was the most corrupt most crony capitalist administration in history and what were republicans in congress doing they were rolling over and being just as corrupt in june  donald trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive antiimmigration stance because he had his own money and his own media celebrity trump did not need to do the proausterity proimmigration profree trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor gop money tree he could just run for president declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didnt have a super pac and he could speak to the workingclass republican voters who had been left behind in this economy by saying hed go after china and give them social security and medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund ripoff artists and they loved it for decades they had been told for partisan reasons to be angry they had been told for partisan reasons that washington was corrupt and that all washington politicians were evil now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins they also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the corrupt things republican establishment types themselves were doing a few months later in september republican speaker john boehner announced he would resign from congress responding to efforts by the house freedom caucus to force him out this was the first time since  that an insurgent faction in the house had successfully challenged a sitting speaker the antiestablishment anger that republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders on the democratic side anticlinton progressives were hoping to draft elizabeth warren who had demonstrated her antiestablishment bona fides in december  sinking obamas appointment of wall street banker antonio weiss for a top treasury position weiss withdrew his nomination instead accepting a counselor position to secretary jack lew warren had also been a prominent opponent of obamas major asian free trade agreement but warren didnt run instead it was selfidentified socialist bernie sanders who found the opening democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for hillary this meant sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative attention that he was able to snowball into a following sanders wont win the nomination but he has done far far better than anybody ever expected because a sizable number of democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win and like sanders they are sick and tired of it if you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time youll see a previous peak around  or so while historical analogies are never perfect there are some notable similarities between now and around  for one  was the last time a sitting speaker of the us house had been effectively challenged from within the party second in  the republican party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered with about half of republicans supporting howard taft the incumbent and about half supporting teddy roosevelt the previous incumbent democrat woodrow wilson won in a landslide around  was also when the last great antiestablishment movement in america the progressive movement emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power concentrations that many americans felt had left them behind as political scientist grant mcconnell once wrote of the progressive legacy it consisted of a charges made against virtually all the institutions of american society with one common theme  corruption  corruption of such prevalence disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slowspreading decay the theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation this resonates with todays antiestablishment mood political scientist hans noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures both economically eg the trusts and politically they disliked political parties and other authority structures in  it was progressive republican george norris who led the internal house revolt against speaker joe cannon stripping cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization like john boehner in  cannon in  represented the culmination of exactly  years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the house speakership just as gingrich had radically centralized control in  speaker thomas reed had radically centralized control in  parties depolarized in the s and s because freed of centralized leadership structures more legislating happened in committees where a crosscutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties interestingly trade policy also became much less polarized in the s with crossparty coalitions on tariff issues most likely trump will be the republican nominee even if the nevertrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him unlikely but possible the antiestablishment forces in the republican party are not going away if not trump though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer somebody in the tea party or possibly even ted cruz will find a way to harness the trump voters by following the trump issues playbook where there are voters to be had there are politicians to have them meanwhile in congress house speaker paul ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process no matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that boehner failed to resolve which means he will have to eventually lean on democrats to pass a budget and like boehner before him alienate some of his party senate majority leader mitch mcconnell much less beloved even within his party will face similar problems most likely hillary clinton will become the th us president she has led in every single headtohead poll against trump and most likely she will use her agendasetting powers to try to force the republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them especially immigration and trade clintons natural home is in the probusiness center a position that will be advantageous to her and democrats in the short term at least but she has to be cautious emboldened by sanders and by elizabeth warren the progressive wing of the democrats is growing and will be unhappy with clintons probusiness instincts the internal fights will continue in both parties the competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true republicansdemocrats the growing importance of outside nonparty groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups but theyd be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas after all the party that does best in american politics is always the one that can build the broadest coalition which means accepting ideological diversity eventually congressional leaders will realize or be forced to realize that the only leadership style that works is a less centralized more committeedriven approach this is the only way ideologically heterogeneous parties can effectively govern a more decentralized congress with more fluid coalitions will function better assuming that a more committeedriven process is also accompanied by increases in congressional staffing capacity partisan control of congress will mean less since there will be more crossparty coalitions many issues like gun rights or affirmative action will remain very partisan but other issues especially those of corporatewall street power antitrust interventionist foreign policy will likely split the parties trump republicans and sanders democrats will find common cause against establishment centrists big organized interests like the chamber of commerce and other corporate groups will align less closely with republicans realizing that their future success will require the right mix of republicans and democrats to advance their agendas and as the parties become more ideological diverse voters who are generally more ideologically all over the place than the current party alignment would suggest will identify less reliably with one or the other since there will be more for them in both parties they will again sometimes split their tickets depending on who is running many will feel more passionate about individual issues and will align themselves with supporters of those issues in both parties especially as individual interest groups become crosspartisan in order to achieve policy outcomes in that respect politics will come to look more like it did in the s and s when liberal republicans existed alongside conservative democrats this is an optimistic scenario but it only works if party leaders tolerate diversity within their party and allow disagreements another scenario is that establishment republicans banish the trump faction and democrats banish the sanders faction after the  elections and both parties go back to the predictable and intractable trench warfare battle lines that have become increasingly dug in over the past two decades using nastier and nastier tactics to subvert internal divisions in service of the larger fight against a common enemy this may be possible for a little while longer especially if the economy improves significantly but it is still probably longterm unsustainable for reasons ive described above it also may mean that  becomes an even more violent and nasty election another possibility is that the parties realign quickly with the trumptea party faction effecting a rapid transformation of the republican party into a downscale nationalist populist party pushing the remaining upperclass moderate republicans into a more probusiness democratic party which in turn pushes some disaffected sanders voters into the republican party if this realignment happens too quickly there is no period of depolarization but this seems unlikely given the stickiness of partisan identity and the strong disagreements between the two parties on a whole range of other issues other scenarios are possible as well especially if there are significant global crises but heres the bottom line something is different this year in american politics the logic that has operated for the past two decades or so is breaking down largely because the factors and trends that propelled it produced unsustainable contradictions american politics is now entering a new logic with new trends and forces that will push the lines of political conflict in directions we are only beginning to understand this feels like chaos and it is but it is also good news because chaos scrambles the rules weve hit peak polarization politics is slowly coming unstuck a period of new possibilities awaits this post is part of polyarchy an independent blog produced by the political reform program at new

4377.0,Anti-Muhammad cartoon contest: Free speech or deliberately provocative? (+video),"Sponsors say that the shootings in Garland, Texas, confirm their view of Islam as violence-prone. But critics say the event was designed to be incendiary and to poison relations at a volatile time.

When Pamela Geller and her controversial organization, the American Freedom Defense Initiative, announced it would hold a cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, their plan to satirize and lampoon the founder of Islam was intended to have both a defiant and provocative free-speech edge.

Sunday’s contest and its $10,000 prize were prompted in part by the Paris Charlie Hebdo massacre in January, Ms. Geller said in March, as well as the riots in Muslim countries sparked by the publication of satirical anti-Muhammad cartoons by a Danish newspaper in 2005. And indeed, as if on cue, two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion, before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night.

The incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught – with protests against Muslims in Texas and anti-Muslim social-media attacks after the release of the film ""American Sniper."" In that context, Geller's actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatred.

It is an issue Geller has faced before. Two weeks ago, she won a federal free-speech case against New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which had refused to put up one of her ads: “Killing Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah” – a quote the ad attributes to “Hamas MTV.”

Geller’s organization has often clashed with officials in other cities, including Philadelphia and Washington, over their incendiary ads, some of which compare Islam to Nazism. In 2012, another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read: “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.”

Many supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violence-prone religion. But for others, her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile time.

“And coming as it did right when we, the United States of America, are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together, I can see this potentially aggravating the already-challenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference, diversity, and what kind of society we want to be,” says Gordon Coonfield, director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near Philadelphia.

After analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiative’s “Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,” Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for “Der Ewige Jude,” or “The Eternal Jew,” a notorious Nazi propaganda “documentary.”

In one of the cartoons, the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hook-nosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife. The caption reads, “When it comes to religion ... I’ve got the edge.” The face, Coonfield notes, is nearly identical to the contorted face of “The Eternal Jew” poster.

“That strategy for creating a sense of ‘unity’ by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture,” he says. “It’s ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used, and the Nazis have become famous for using – propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst ... so it’s kind of ironic that she’s trying to link some of these things together, when that is in fact her message.”

Despite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity, Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on Sunday.

“Her words are not just free speech,” says Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. “They are inciteful; they incite hate against our whole community. I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland, Texas, but at the same time, Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that we’re in right now.”

“She intentionally put that event together in hopes that she’d get the response that she received,” Ms. Sarsour says.

“We prayed, but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her,” she added. “Muslim leaders specifically told people, do not go anywhere near her. Let her do whatever she does. We don’t care. And there was no protesting outside – unfortunately, except for these two guys from Arizona, who were already on the radar of the FBI anyway.”

Advocates have tried to counter Geller’s free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone. In 2012, a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her “support the civilized man” poster with an opposing message that read, “In the choice between love and hate, choose love. Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors.”

And last week, the makers of the satirical film “The Muslims Are Coming!” launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Geller's. “The Muslims are coming, and they shall strike with hugs so fierce, you’ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love her.”

But in an era in which the Islamic State, the Tsarnaev trial, and the lingering aftermath of 9/11 still inflame fears about Islam, many worry that Sunday’s violence will exacerbate the current tensions.

“Free speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most, that you disagree with the most, and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric,” Coonfield says. “This can’t become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East. We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it, without resorting to this kind of craziness.”",REAL,sponsors say that the shootings in garland texas confirm their view of islam as violenceprone but critics say the event was designed to be incendiary and to poison relations at a

9360.0,Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up),"Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) Posted on Home » Silver » Silver News » Ying and Yang (the Gold and Silver Set-Up) No, this is not a post about some new Chinese law firm. Instead, it’s just an update on the gold and silver markets which, while refusing to go further down, aren’t making much progress to the upside, either. From Craig Hemke, TFMetalsReport : Today’s message: A few more slightly positive US economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a December FF rate hike a fait accompli. Again, though…and I can’t stress this enough… we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last October and November in the run up to the most recent FF rate hike. And what happened beginning the very next day? Well, by now you know the story. The week of the October 2o15 FOMC produced a high trade in the Dec15 contract of $1183. As the Fedlines were digested later that week, it became clear that the Fed was going to raise the FF rate at the December 2015 meeting come hell or high water. And they did. However, take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the Oct15 FOMC and the December rate hike. Price fell from $1180 to $1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual “news” of the FF rate hike. This 10+% drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the Specs at the Comex. How bad was it? From the CoT survey of 10/27/15, just one day before that fateful FOMC and Fedlines, the Large Specs in gold were NET long more than 157,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short nearly 166,000. Just five weeks later, the NET position of the Large Specs was down to only 10,000 contracts with the Commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2,911 contracts NET short. We even speculated at the time that there were some days, intraweek, where the Gold Commercials were actually and historically NET LONG. Well now compare last autumn to our current situation. Just as back then, a FF rate hike is a near certainty at the FOMC in December. However, as you know, the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages in late September. Take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above: In 2015, we had the October FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Before price turned, we slogged through 5-6 weeks of consolidation and CoT improvement before the blast higher began. In 2016, we had the September FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Price is attempting to bottom and turn while the CoT improves, but it doesn’t seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher. In 2015, the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place. The rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength, which led to Chinese devaluations, which led to emerging market crises, which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 5-10% off its lows by late January before the real fun began with the USDJPY falling 10% in early February. Are we headed down that same path again? It certainly appears so as the first major salvos of Chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-20/dear-janet-china-devalues-most-august-yuan-tumbles-lowest-sept-2010 And, just as in 2015, the CoT is certainly undergoing a makeover, too. From the survey of 9/27/16, the Large Specs in gold were NET long 292,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short 325,000. As of last Tuesday and just three weeks later, the Large Specs were down to 180,000 NET long for a reduction of 38% and the Commercials were NET short 203,000. To be sure, these are still hefty positions but much more “bullish” than the levels seen through the past summer. And now check the full long-term chart. You can see again the similarities between now and last fall. Also be sure to note, however, that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher. So while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longer…the Ying and Yang mentioned in the title of this post…it is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the now-expected FOMC FF rate hike will be simply another “sell-the-rumor, buy-the-news” type of event for gold and silver. This current period of relative quiet should be used to prepare for the next leg UP, not some sort of new bear market where paper prices are sharply falling. Use your time wisely and continue to prepare/stack accordingly.

909.0,"Closed primaries, 'warped' democracy?","Political parties choose their presidential nominees. But with more Americans opting out of parties, is the process representative of what America wants? The New York primary – and others ahead – offer insights.

How SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too true

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks to supporter Michael Cantalupo while taking a walk in New York's Times Square Tuesday. Mr. Cantalupo said he is unable to vote in the New York primaries

Denise Guardascione, a waitress for nearly three decades at the Shalimar Diner in Queens, thinks the New York primary process was rigged.

She’s a vocal supporter of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, but as a registered Democrat, Ms. Guardascione missed the deadline to switch her registration to become a Republican – which, shocking to her, was more than six months ago.

And now, the independent-minded waitress has become bewildered by what seems to be the complicated, back-room system of electing party delegates both in her own state and across the country.

“It’s antiquated, it belongs in the Smithsonian, next to Archie Bunker’s chair!” says Ms. Guardascione, a Queens native who works six days a week slinging eggs and coffee for this well-known political haunt. “It’s just for the [expletive] bigwigs and muckety mucks, not us, not the people who just want to vote.”

In truth, presidential primaries have never been more open. Since 1972, primaries have gone from being the province of party bosses to vibrant voter-driven contests. But in this year of populist revolt in both parties, “more open” looks to many voters like “still pretty antiquated.”

That is by design. Parties, after all, are not democratic. They can choose their nominees in whichever way they think is best. But at a time when Democrats and Republicans are a shrinking share of the population, closed primaries are shutting more and more of America out.

The irony is that America is no less partisan. Research suggests the growing ranks of independents are just as partisan as the parties. These voters have just abandoned parties because they are ashamed by how the parties act.

The anger over closed primaries, superdelegates, and convention arcana isn’t likely to help. (Nor are allegations of irregularities in the New York primary. On Thursday, the state's Elections Board suspended the top official in charge of Brooklyn after numerous allegations, the most serious of which is that 125,000 Democratic voters were incorrectly purged from the rolls before polls opened.)

The question is, whether the spotlight of this election could force further change ahead, both in states and in the nation.

“New York and other states have long given power to the parties and to the establishment,” says Jeanne Zaino, a political scientist at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. “But who has higher voting turnout? States that have early voting, states that have mail in ballots and same day registration. We in New York allow none of that. This was not just a closed primary, this was an ultra-closed primary. Whether you’re running for office or voting, you had to be on top of your game to be a part of it.”

The knock against closed primaries in this election season has been that they hurt insurgent candidates like Trump and Bernie Sanders. But the picture isn’t so simple.

Yes, Senator Sanders of Vermont has done much better among independents. But his biggest wins – in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington state – all came in closed primaries or caucuses.

Trump, meanwhile, has in many cases actually done better among Republicans than independents.

What is clear is that the primary rules disenfranchise those who most dislike the parties. “So why is Sanders doing so well among independents?” asks Dan Hopkins of the FiveThirtyEight data journalism website. “It appears to be driven not by their ideology so much as their dislike of partisan politics.”

In one respect, that makes sense. Why would parties give vote to someone who doesn’t like them?

Yet those people are a growing share of the American electorate. Some 39 percent Americans now identify as independents; 32 percent say they’re Democrats, and 23 percent say they’re Republicans, according to a Pew Research Center survey last year.

In 2000, 29 percent were independents, 33 percent were Democrats, and 28 percent were Republicans, Pew found

In Tuesday’s closed primary, “three million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary,” Sanders said. “That’s wrong.”

It almost certainly hurt Sanders. In Michigan, for example, Hillary Clinton won the Democratic vote by 58 to 40 percent – similar to the 58 to 42 percent margin in New York. But since Michigan was an open primary where independents could vote, Sanders won the state by taking 71 percent of independent voters.

Eight of the 16 remaining primary contests – including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland – are closed contests.

Sanders and his supporters have also complained about the fact that 15 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention – 712 out of 4,763 – are party leaders known as “superdelegates,” who overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton.

In short, the deck is stacked against Sanders. And intentionally so.

Sanders isn’t a Democrat; he’s an independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist. It is not illogical that Democratic primaries should favor an actual Democrat.

The same is true, in different ways, for Trump. The GOP front-runner won a solid victory in New York. But he's getting little help from the establishment in navigating the complex delegate rules – rules that he says are rigged. Meanwhile, the well-organized campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him in Louisiana and swept Colorado’s state convention contest.

Presidents have always gone through a complex, multilayered processes in which voters, local officials, and party leaders each have their role, scholars say. Party leaders should have no small say in choosing their party’s presidential nominee, the thinking goes.

But even within the parties, there is some restlessness for change. “Closed primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance,” said Charles Schumer (D) of New York, now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, to The New York Times in 2014.

As America’s political balance increasingly settles outside either of the two parties, 2016 is showing how even a more open system can be warped.

“And if part of that story is about disenfranchisement, it is about these younger voters, people who are new to the process, or who disengaged from it and didn’t register, or registered as independent and couldn’t vote,” says Professor Zaino.

“You’re talking about Sanders supporters who are going to be on the losing end of that.”",REAL,political parties choose their presidential nominees but with more americans opting out of parties is the

hillary clinton won the democratic vote by  to  percent  similar to the  to  percent margin in new york but since michigan was an open primary where independents could vote sanders won the state by taking  percent of independent voters eight of the  remaining primary contests  including pennsylvania new jersey and maryland  are closed contests sanders and his supporters have also complained about the fact that  percent of the delegates to the democratic national convention   out of   are party leaders known as superdelegates who overwhelmingly support mrs clinton in short the deck is stacked against sanders and intentionally so sanders isnt a democrat hes an independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist it is not illogical that democratic primaries should favor an actual democrat the same is true in different ways for trump the gop frontrunner won a solid victory in new york but hes getting little help from the establishment in navigating the complex delegate rules  rules that he says are rigged meanwhile the wellorganized campaign of sen ted cruz outmaneuvered him in louisiana and swept colorados state convention contest presidents have always gone through a complex multilayered processes in which voters local officials and party leaders each have their role scholars say party leaders should have no small say in choosing their partys presidential nominee the thinking goes but even within the parties there is some restlessness for change closed primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance said charles schumer d of new york now the no  democrat in the senate to the new york times in  as americas political balance increasingly settles outside either of the two parties  is showing how even a more open system can be warped and if part of that story is about disenfranchisement it is about these younger voters people who are new to the process or who disengaged from it and didnt register or registered as independent and couldnt vote says professor zaino youre talking about sanders supporters who are going to be on the losing end of that,"['political', 'parties', 'choose', 'presidential',

1522.0,Donald Trump: Hillary Clinton has 'caused tremendous death',"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has a new attack line against Hillary Clinton: ""She has caused death.""

Trump raised the stakes against Clinton on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, insisting that as secretary of State in President Obama's first term, Clinton's decisions led to unnecessary deaths on both sides in the Middle East.

""She has caused tremendous death with incompetent decisions,"" Trump said. ""She caused a lot of the problems that we have right now. You could say she caused the migration.

""The entire world has been upset. The entire world, it's a different place. During Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's term, she's done a horrible job.""

As he has said before, Trump argued that getting rid of Saddam Hussein in Iraq -- a policy of Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush -- has led to the rise of the Islamic State. ""All of this has led to tremendous death and destruction,"" he said. ""And she, for the most part, was in charge of it, along with Obama.""

Trump acknowledged that by calling for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States, he was giving radical Islam a rallying cry. The terrorist group al-Shabaab is now using  a clip of Trump in calling for Muslims to join jihad or leave the U.S.

""What am I going to do? I have to say what I have to say,"" Trump said. ""And you know what I have to say? There's a problem. We have to find out what is the problem. And we have to solve that problem.""

During the interview, Trump also disagreed with Obama on the need for more gun control -- particularly if the president tries to move the issue by executive action rather than working with a recalcitrant Congress. ""All they want to do is blame the guns. And it's not the gun that pulls the trigger,"" he said. ""So I don't like it. I don't like what he's doing.""

Rather than fiddle with the Second Amendment, Trump said mental health is the problem. ""We should build, like, institutions for people that are sickos,"" he said. ""We have sickos all over the place. And that's the problem.""

Despite his lead in national polls, Trump said he will spend about $2 million per week on advertising in the coming weeks leading to the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. ""I think I'm probably wasting the money,"" he said. ""But I'm $35 million under budget.... I almost feel guilty.""",REAL,republican presidential frontrunner donald trump has a new attack line against hillary clinton she has caused death trump raised the stakes against clinton on cbs face the nation sunday insisting that as secretary of state in president obamas first term clintons decisions led to unnecessary deaths on both sides in the middle east she has caused tremendous death with incompetent decisions trump said she caused a lot of the problems that we have right now you could say she caused the migration the entire world has been upset the entire world its a different place during barack obama and hillary clintons term shes done a horrible job as he has said before trump argued that getting rid of saddam hussein in iraq  a policy of obamas predecessor george w bush  has led to the rise of the islamic state all of this has led to tremendous death and destruction he said and she for the most part was in charge of it along with obama trump acknowledged that by calling for a ban on muslim immigration to the united states he was giving radical islam a rallying cry the terrorist group alshabaab is now using a clip of trump in calling for muslims to join jihad or leave the us what am i going to do i have to say what i have to say trump said and you know what i have to say theres a problem we have to find out what is the problem and we have to solve that problem during the interview trump also disagreed with obama on the need for more gun control  particularly if the president tries to move the issue by executive action rather than working with a recalcitrant congress all they want to do is blame the guns and its not the gun that pulls the trigger he said so i dont like it i dont like what hes doing rather than fiddle with the second amendment trump said mental health is the problem we should build like institutions for people that are sickos he said we have sickos all over the place and thats the problem despite his lead in national polls trump said he will spend about  million per week on advertising in the coming weeks leading to the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary i think im probably wasting the money he said but im  million under budget i almost feel guilty,"['republican', 'presidential', 'frontrunner', 'donald', 'trump', 'new', 'attack', 'line', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'caused', 'death', 'trump', 'raised', 'stakes', 'clinton', 'cbs', 'face', 'nation', 'sunday', 'insisting', 'secretary', 'state', 'president', 'obamas', 'first', 'term', 'clintons', 'decisions', 'led', 'unnecessary', 'deaths', 'sides', 'middle', 'east', 'caused', 'tremendous', 'death', 'incompetent', 'decisions', 'trump', 'said', 'caused', 'lot', 'problems', 'right', 'could', 'say', 'caused', 'migration', 'entire', 'world', 'upset', 'entire', 'world', 'different', 'place', 'barack', 'obama', 'hillary', 'clintons', 'term', 'shes', 'done', 'horrible', 'job', 'said', 'trump', 'argued', 'getting', 'rid', 'saddam', 'hussein', 'iraq', 'policy', 'obamas', 'predecessor', 'george', 'w', 'bush', 'led', 'rise', 'islamic', 'state', 'led', 'tremendous', 'death', 'destruction', 'said', 'part', 'charge', 'along', 'obama', 'trump', 'acknowledged', 'calling', 'ban', 'muslim', 'immigration', 'united', 'states', 'giving', 'radical', 'islam', 'rallying', 'cry', 'terrorist', 'group', 'alshabaab', 'using', 'clip', 'trump', 'calling', 'muslims', 'join', 'jihad', 'leave', 'us', 'going', 'say', 'say', 'trump', 'said', 'know', 'say', 'theres', 'problem', 'find', 'problem', 'solve', 'problem', 'interview', 'trump', 'also', 'disagreed', 'obama', 'need', 'gun', 'control', 'particularly', 'president', 'tries', 'move', 'issue', 'executive', 'action', 'rather', 'working', 'recalcitrant', 'congress', 'want', 'blame', 'guns', 'gun', 'pulls', 'trigger', 'said', 'dont', 'like', 'dont', 'like', 'hes', 'rather', 'fiddle', 'second', 'amendment', 'trump', 'said', 'mental', 'health', 'problem', 'build', 'like', 'institutions', 'people', 'sickos', 'said', 'sickos', 'place', 'thats', 'problem', 'despite', 'lead', 'national', 'polls', 'trump', 'said', 'spend', 'million', 'per', 'week', 'advertising', 'coming', 'weeks', 'leading', 'iowa', 'caucuses', 'new', 'hampshire', 'primary', 'think', 'im', 'probably', 'wasting', 'money', 'said', 'im', 'million', 'budget', 'almost', 'feel', 'guilty']","['NORP', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'ORDINAL', 'LOC', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'ORDINAL', 'MONEY', 'DATE', 'GPE']","{'PERSON': 6, 'NORP': 5, 'GPE': 4, 'ORG': 2, 'DATE': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'LOC': 1, 'MONEY': 1}",2,6,4,405,0.031444313262495076,35
7540.0,Detroit women’s Halloween decorations depict ‘real-life horrors’ … such as shootings police by police,"Print 
[Ed. – How to take the fun out of Halloween.] 
As Halloween approaches, hair-raising yard displays can often cause people to stop, gawk and whip out their cellphones. 
Larethia Haddon is well aware of that, and is using it to shine some light on real-life horrors, rather than typical Halloween themes. 
In her yard at the corner of Mendota and Santa Maria avenues in Detroit, there are six dummies portraying police shootings, slain children, the Flint water crisis, and other horrors. 
Last year, a single dummy placed face-down in the grass, realistically depicting a dead body in her yard, shocked passersby and caused fearful calls to the police. 
This time around, Haddon wants to inspire a broader range of thought, rather than just shock. 
“We’re trying to do something positive instead of just having a dead body laying in the yard,” she said. “Want to get people to be a little more focused on the issues, what’s going on in the world. We need to stick together more. We need to come together. And if we don’t, this scene in my yard is going to be reality every single day.”",FAKE,print ed  how to take the fun out of halloween as halloween approaches hairraising yard displays can often cause people to stop gawk and whip out their cellphones larethia haddon is well aware of that and is using it to shine some light on reallife horrors rather than typical halloween themes in her yard at the corner of mendota and santa maria avenues in detroit there are six dummies portraying police shootings slain children the flint water crisis and other horrors last year a single dummy placed facedown in the grass realistically depicting a dead body in her yard shocked passersby and caused fearful calls to the police this time around haddon wants to inspire a broader range of thought rather than just shock were trying to do something positive instead of just having a dead body laying in the yard she said want to get people to be a little more focused on the issues whats going on in the world we need to stick together more we need to come together and if we dont this scene in my yard is going to be reality every single day,"['print', 'ed', 'take', 'fun', 'halloween', 'halloween', 'approaches', 'hairraising', 'yard', 'displays', 'often', 'cause', 'people', 'stop', 'gawk', 'whip', 'cellphones', 'larethia', 'haddon', 'well', 'aware', 'using', 'shine', 'light', 'reallife', 'horrors', 'rather', 'typical', 'halloween', 'themes', 'yard', 'corner', 'mendota', 'santa', 'maria', 'avenues', 'detroit', 'six', 'dummies', 'portraying', 'police', 'shootings', 'slain', 'children', 'flint', 'water', 'crisis', 'horrors', 'last', 'year', 'single', 'dummy', 'placed', 'facedown', 'grass', 'realistically', 'depicting', 'dead', 'body', 'yard', 'shocked', 'passersby', 'caused', 'fearful', 'calls', 'police', 'time', 'around', 'haddon', 'wants', 'inspire', 'broader', 'range', 'thought', 'rather', 'shock', 'trying', 'something', 'positive', 'instead', 'dead', 'body', 'laying', 'yard', 'said', 'want', 'get', 'people', 'little', 'focused', 'issues', 'whats', 'going', 'world', 'need', 'stick', 'together', 'need', 'come', 'together', 'dont', 'scene', 'yard', 'going', 'reality', 'every', 'single', 'day']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'DATE']","{'DATE': 5, 'GPE': 3, 'PERSON': 1, 'ORG': 1, 'CARDINAL': 1}",1,1,3,190,-0.014397122485357773,33

1775.0,"Hillary Clinton's declining favorability numbers, in context","Buried beneath Wednesday's eye-popping headlines about Hillary Clinton's sinking favorability ratings, you'll find the reason that she's still on course to win the Democratic primary.

First, the headline number: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton, an 8 percentage point increase since July. Her favorable rating has declined by 7 percentage points to 45 percent over the same period of time, and the split among registered voters is even worse for her, at 56 percent unfavorable to 43 percent favorable. A majority of women (51 percent) now view her unfavorably. None of that is good news for Clinton.

She's been on a pretty steady drop from the moment she left the State Department in early 2013. That was a foreseeable outcome of Clinton moving back into domestic partisan politics after four years of representing America's interests abroad. Ellen Tauscher, a former member of Congress and undersecretary of state, warned Clinton that would happen in a private conversation about Clinton's political future in September 2011, when about two-thirds of Americans rated her favorably.

But what's apparent — and of more immediate interest to Clinton — is that she's still better regarded among Democrats than Vice President Joe Biden, who is still weighing whether to run against her. Biden's dead-even 46 percent to 46 percent favorable/unfavorable rating is better than Clinton's, but the edge is based on him having higher numbers with Republicans and independents, the vast majority of whom won't vote in the Democratic primaries.

A full 80 percent of Democrats view Clinton favorably, compared with 70 percent who feel that way about Biden. Her number among African Americans is 79 percent, and it's 68 percent among Hispanics. By comparison, Biden is viewed favorably by just 67 percent of African Americans and 49 percent of Hispanics.

That helps explain why Clinton is blowing her Democratic competition out of the water in national horse-race polls. She was up 35 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a PPP poll conducted August 28 to 30 and held a 45-22-18 lead over Sanders and Biden in a Quinnipiac survey conducted from August 20 to 25.

She's also doing much better on the favorability scale than either Republican frontrunner Donald Trump or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump checked in with a favorable number that has risen to 37 percent, about the same as Bush's 38 percent. Trump had an unfavorable score of 59 percent, while Bush was at 55 percent.

The Clinton ship has taken on water. But, along with other recent surveys, this poll tell us that Clinton is still running away with her party's nomination and remains in better position than any of her Republican or Democratic rivals to advance to the all-important second round of the presidential race. For someone who lost the 2008 primary in part because she looked ahead to the general election, it makes sense to focus on winning the primary first in 2016. On that score, she's still in great shape.",REAL,buried beneath wednesdays eyepopping headlines about hillary clintons sinking favorability ratings youll find the reason that shes still on course to

8212.0,Comment on Quid Pro Quo? Wikileaks Email Reveals Clinton Campaign Eyeing Paul Ryan’s Relative for Supreme Court by lenore.lee,"New Wikileaks email dumps have revealed massive corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta . In one email dated February 29, 2016, an article sent by Hillary advisor Sara Solow to Podesta and Hillary’s foreign policy advisor Jake Sullivan indicates that the Clinton campaign is considering House Speaker Paul Ryan’s relative for the Supreme Court . 
Ketanji Brown is the subject of the article. She is related to Paul Ryan by marriage and is a judge on the US District Court for the District of Columbia. 
The email reads, “She was confirmed by without any Republican opposition in the Senate not once, but *twice*. She was confirmed to her current position in 2013 by unanimous consent – that is, without any stated opposition. She was also previously confirmed unanimously to a seat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission (where she became vice chair).” 
“Her family is impressive. She is married to a surgeon and has two young daughters. Her father is a retired lawyer and her mother a retired school principal. Her brother was a police officer (in the unit that was the basis for the television show * The Wire *) and is now a law student, and she is related by marriage to Congressman (and Speaker of the House) Paul Ryan.” 
Earlier this month, he even said he would not campaign for nor support his party’s nominee, Donald Trump . In fact, some supporters of Trump have theorized that Ryan was somehow behind or involved in the leak of the tape in which Trump made sexually crude comments about women. 
If you claim this is merely circumstantial, then I think there is no hope for you understanding just how corrupt DC has gotten, and this is the very Paul Ryan I warned you about in 2012, which everyone said was “so conservative.” Sadly, many didn’t listen and voted for liberal Mitt Romney and him. Perhaps Paul Ryan’s records and emails should be leaked and maybe we just might see that he’s willing to engage Hillary in a pay-to-play scheme .

3363.0,Hillary Clinton: The criminal investigation keeps moving forward,"While the country has been fixated on Donald Trump's tormenting his Republican primary opponents and deeply concerned about the government’s efforts to identify any confederates in the San Bernardino, California, killings, a team of federal prosecutors and FBI agents continues to examine Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state in order to determine whether she committed any crimes and, if so, whether there is sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

What began as an innocent Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch, a D.C.-based public advocacy group promoting transparency in the executive branch, has now become a full criminal investigation, with Clinton as the likely target.

The basic facts are well-known, but the revealed nuances are important, as well. When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit. When the State Department made the same representation to the court -- as incredible as it seemed at the time -- the judge accepted that representation, and the case was dismissed.

Then The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government’s server for all of her work-related and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state. After that, the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated, and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton’s emails.

When Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails, the judge ordered Clinton, “under penalty of perjury,” to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department.

Eventually, Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department. She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails, because she had wiped clean her server. She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department. She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked ""classified” while secretary of state using her private server.

All of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes. For example, it is a crime to steal federal property. What did she steal? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that, when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee, belong to the government -- she stole that data. The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata.

This is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property. (She is probably already barred from public office -- though this was not prominently raised when she entered the U.S. Senate or the Department of State -- because of the china, silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001.)

Clinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her. She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected, nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues. The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked ""classified” is that protected government secrets are not marked “classified.”

So her statement, though technically true, is highly misleading. The governmental designations of protected secrets are “confidential,” “secret” and “top secret” -- not “classified.” State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets.

Back when Clinton became secretary of state, on her first day in office, she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets. She signed a statement, under penalty of perjury, acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails, not any stamped markings, that makes them secret.

Earlier this week, my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of top-secret materials among the 999 emails. Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always top-secret, whether designated as such or not. And she knows that.

As well, she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi, in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, gathered emails, it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department.

Last week, the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate. These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her family's foundation, her husband and her son-in-law. Moreover, the FBI knows of a treasure-trove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions.

Two months ago, a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far. Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward. At the end of the meeting, it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigation.

And Clinton is the likely target.

1084.0,Rubio’s parting shot at Trump,"It was not supposed to end like this for Marco Rubio.

Eleven months ago, he launched his presidential campaign in front of Miami’s Freedom Tower, the Ellis Island for his and other Cuban families. In his rapid rise, young Rubio had been a darling of both the tea party movement and the conservative intelligentsia — the Republicans’ best hope of attracting nonwhite voters.

But then came vulgar Donald Trump. Rubio was savaged on everything from immigration to his height. On Tuesday night, Rubio, his campaign fading, lost his home state of Florida to the bigoted demagogue who makes scapegoats of foreigners and minorities. Bowing to the inevitable, Rubio ended his candidacy.

By the time Rubio’s campaign bus rolled to its final pre-primary stop — an outdoor basketball court here where he played as a boy — only a couple-hundred supporters were on hand, nearly equaled by the number of journalists on death watch.

Before Rubio arrived, a prankster hijacked the microphone and was chased off by campaign aides. When Rubio himself spoke, the sound system failed, so he delivered his valedictory with a bullhorn.

[The GOP establishment has failed. It’s up to voters to deny Trump.]

Rubio’s voice sounded tinny, but his words were rich with nostalgia as he recalled knocking on doors when he ran for city commissioner here. “In between sips of sweet Cuban coffee, I heard the stories of their youth, of the dreams they lost,” he said. “That has carried me every single day throughout this campaign, knowing that my worst days are better than some of the best days that many people in this community have had.”

These are not the best days for Rubio, or for anybody who cares about American democracy. The 44-year-old made mistakes during his campaign: freezing in the New Hampshire debate, failing to take on Trump earlier, then finally attacking Trump by joking about genitalia.

Yet he finished honorably. He spoke reflectively Monday about Trump’s brutal transformation of politics. This message should have been delivered much earlier, but it deserves to be heard even now.

“Leadership is not about going to an angry and frustrated people and saying you should be even angrier and more frustrated, and you should be angry and frustrated at each other,” Rubio told a gym full of Christian college students in West Palm Beach. “That’s called demagoguery. And it’s dangerous.” It leads, he said, to “where we are today, a nation where people literally hate each other because they’re voting for different candidates. . . . And it leaves us incapable of solving problems.”

Trump tore up the norms of decency that remained in American politics, and Rubio expressed puzzlement that it worked. “My whole life I’ve been told being humble is a virtue, and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and self-absorbed is somehow a virtue,” he said. “My whole life I’ve been told no matter how you feel about someone, you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God — and now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness.”

Rubio voiced regret for his own role in the vulgarity, saying he “felt terrible” for joking about Trump’s penis size. Such remorse separates Rubio from Trump, who seems to have no shame as he blurts obscenities, delivers insults and winks at violence. “There are people, I know, who like this stuff because he says what they want to be able to say, [but] presidents can’t say whatever they want to say,” Rubio told the students, mentioning the harm to America’s reputation that Trump has already done. “We’re not a Third World country. We’re the United States of America.”

[Donald Trump just threatened more violence. Only this time, it’s directed at the GOP.]

That’s the welcoming country to which Rubio’s parents immigrated, settling among the shoe-box homes here in Cuban West Miami. “Everywhere I go I tell the story of this community of people, many of whom lost their country in their youth,” Rubio said Monday night in his boyhood park, his kids beside him in the bed of his Dodge pickup.

He spoke, in English, then in Spanish, with the requisite optimism, telling supporters he looked forward to moving his “caja china” — Cuban barbecue — to the White House.

“If there’s no car, we’ll go in a raft!” a supporter said in Spanish.

Another said in English: “Don’t give up, man!”

But Rubio’s speech to his modest band had the ring of a farewell. “I will always be a son of this community. I will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of generations that made possible the dreams of mine,” he said. His candidacy, he said, “was possible because you and I happen to live in the one place on Earth where even the son of a bartender and a maid from West Miami can be president.”

Or at least he can lose to a trash-talking rich guy from Queens.

conservative intelligentsia  the republicans best hope of attracting nonwhite voters but then came vulgar donald trump rubio was savaged on everything from immigration to his height on tuesday night rubio his campaign fading lost his home state of florida to the bigoted demagogue who makes scapegoats of foreigners and minorities bowing to the inevitable rubio ended his candidacy by the time rubios campaign bus rolled to its final preprimary stop  an outdoor basketball court here where he played as a boy  only a couplehundred supporters were on hand nearly equaled by the number of journalists on death watch before rubio arrived a prankster hijacked the microphone and was chased off by campaign aides when rubio himself spoke the sound system failed so he delivered his valedictory with a bullhorn the gop establishment has failed its up to voters to deny trump rubios voice sounded tinny but his words were rich with nostalgia as he recalled knocking on doors when he ran for city commissioner here in between sips of sweet cuban coffee i heard the stories of their youth of the dreams they lost he said that has carried me every single day throughout this campaign knowing that my worst days are better than some of the best days that many people in this community have had these are not the best days for rubio or for anybody who cares about american democracy the yearold made mistakes during his campaign freezing in the new hampshire debate failing to take on trump earlier then finally attacking trump by joking about genitalia yet he finished honorably he spoke reflectively monday about trumps brutal transformation of politics this message should have been delivered much earlier but it deserves to be heard even now leadership is not about going to an angry and frustrated people and saying you should be even angrier and more frustrated and you should be angry and frustrated at each other rubio told a gym full of christian college students in west palm beach thats called demagoguery and its dangerous it leads he said to where we are today a nation where people literally hate each other because theyre voting for different candidates    and it leaves us incapable of solving problems trump tore up the norms of decency that remained in american politics and rubio expressed puzzlement that it worked my whole life ive been told being humble is a virtue and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and selfabsorbed is somehow a virtue he said my whole life ive been told no matter how you feel about someone you respect everyone because we are all children of the same god  and now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness rubio voiced regret for his own role in the vulgarity saying he felt terrible for joking about trumps penis size such remorse separates rubio from trump who seems to have no shame as he blurts obscenities delivers insults and winks at violence there are people i know who like this stuff because he says what they want to be able to say but presidents cant say whatever they want to say rubio told the students mentioning the harm to americas reputation that trump has already done were not a third world country were the united states of america donald trump just threatened more violence only this time its directed at the gop thats the welcoming country to which rubios parents immigrated settling among the shoebox homes here in cuban west miami everywhere i go i tell the story of this community of people many of whom lost their country in their youth rubio said monday night in his boyhood park his kids beside him in the bed of his dodge pickup he spoke in english then in spanish with the requisite optimism telling supporters he looked forward to moving his caja china  cuban barbecue  to the white house if theres no car well go in a raft a supporter said in spanish another said in english dont give up man but rubios speech to his modest band had the ring of a farewell i will always be a son of this community i will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of generations that made possible the dreams of mine he said his candidacy he said was possible because you and i happen to live in the one place on earth where even the son of a bartender and a maid from west miami can be president or at least he can lose to a trashtalking rich guy from queens

4410.0,Loretta Lynch becomes first African-American woman AG.,"Washington (CNN) Loretta Lynch was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney general on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. Lynch, the country's first African-American woman to serve in the role, had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate.

""Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,"" said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony.

The highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch

But the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions. Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill. That legislation passed Wednesday, setting up Thursday's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff.

Ten Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote.

Obama tapped Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder in November and her nomination cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. Still, she waited longer than the seven most recent U.S. attorneys general combined for a vote on the Senate floor, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted on first finishing work on an unrelated bill.

Loretta Lynch's father, Lorenzo A. Lynch, was in the Senate gallery watching when the historic vote took place confirming her daughter as the first African American female attorney general.

""The good guys won. That's what has happened in this country all along,"" Lorenzo Lynch told reporters. ""Even during slavery. Levi Coffin was a founder of the Underground Railroad. Even during slavery. A white man fought against slavery. So all over this land good folks have stood in the right lane, in the right path.""

A two-time U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch takes on the high-profile job at time when America faces a series of challenges, from dealing with strained relations and deep distrust in some cities between the police and the communities they serve, to criminal justice reform, to confronting the ongoing threat of terrorism.

Lynch, 55, has earned a reputation as a highly qualified, but low-profile prosecutor who has a good relationship with law enforcement and a history of handling tough cases well.

She is a good listener and a skilled consensus builder, qualities that will help her succeed at Justice, said Tim Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia who served under Lynch on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, a group that meets regularly to advise the Justice department on policy matters.

""In that [attorney general] job you are at the center of so many of the emerging, significant, pressing issues not only in this country but around the world. There's probably no job in government as diverse and challenging as being attorney general of the United States,"" Heaphy said. He added that building support for initiatives both within and outside the department is an important part of the job.

""She will be good at getting people to work well together. I think that's a strength of hers. I saw that on the committee,"" Heaphy said.

Lynch's portfolio will include addressing voting rights, white-collar crime and policy reviews, as well as public corruption, an area in which she has vast experience.

In a statement, Obama said America will be better off with Lynch leading the Department of Jusice.

""Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law,"" Obama said in a statement shortly after the vote.

Lynch's experience on civil rights case, like helping win the convictions of New York City police officers who sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, will be important as her office tackles closely watched investigations in recent police conduct cases, including the still unexplained death of a 25-year-old Baltimore man while in police custody.

""She's seen and understands the injustices that have taken place in the past and so therefore she's uniquely also equipped to deal with what's going on and do the kinds of investigations that will restore faith to Americans in their justice system,"" said Rep. Greg Meeks, D-New York.

Born in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lynch grew up 60 miles to the east in Durham, North Carolina. Her father was a fourth-generation Baptist minister; her mother, an English teacher and school librarian. As a child, Lynch rode on her father's shoulders to his church, which served a meeting place for students organizing anti-segregation boycotts in the early 1960s, she told the Judiciary panel at her January confirmation hearing. Lynch eventually graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.

Speaking at her nomination announcement in November, Lynch highlighted the fact that the Justice Department is named for an ideal.

""This is actually appropriate, because our work is both aspirational, and grounded in gritty reality,"" she said. ""Today, I stand before you so thrilled, and, frankly, so humbled to have the opportunity to lead this group of wonderful people who work all day and well into the night to make that ideal a manifest reality.""

At a conference meeting with all the nation's U.S. attorneys a few years ago, Heaphy was put in charge of organizing a presentation showing the attorneys as they were 20 years before. Lynch shared a picture of herself with her college cheerleading squad.

""Loretta sent me a picture of her as a Harvard cheerleader in a pyramid,"" he said. ""She was comfortable sharing this with Eric Holder and other department leaders. She laughed at herself.""

""I don't think she's just tough, there's a humanity, there's a human touch that she has that will also serve her well,"" he said. ""Nobody is going to mistake that she's in charge, but her humility and sense of humor will come through.""",REAL,washington cnn loretta lynch was sworn in as the new us attorney general on monday

2669.0,Why it's funny Republicans are upset with Facebook: Column,"GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online.

America’s right wing is in a froth about allegations that Facebook has tweaked its “trending news” feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites.

It’s not clear if the allegations, from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources, are true and Facebook denies them. But the deeper problem is undeniably real: Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities — corporate and governmental — that are gaining control over news, freedom of expression and much of our digital lives. The irony is that the conservatives and business-backed Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control.

Almost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word. Along with Google, it dominates online advertising; Facebook especially does so on mobile devices, which are the way many people connect to the Internet. If you offer news and information online, you have almost no choice but to play on Facebook’s field because so much of your audience is there. (In some parts of the world, Facebook essentially is the Internet, because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and, or governments.)

Facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition: Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus. This is smart — no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists — but it’s also a red flag. As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago, he wants Facebook to be “like electricity.” Well, electricity is a utility. And we regulate utilities.

Monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members. They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition. It’s their nature. Which is why capitalism, plainly the best system when it’s working right, needs rules to promote competition.

Yet Republicans, in general, think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition. They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive, at best — except, of course, when a powerful constituent (a corporation, usually) is in danger from predatory behavior.

That attitude accounts for the GOP’s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access. Republicans, in general, are fine with the idea that one or two companies (say the leading cable provider and another telecom) should control access in most communities, and utterly opposed to a remedy — what we call network neutrality — to ensure that people at the edges of networks, not dominant Internet service providers, should decide what information they want and at what priority.

I don’t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish and don’t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress. But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online. I want government to use antitrust and other pro-competition laws to ensure that Facebook doesn’t abuse its dominance in a business sense. I want government(s) to promote open technology and communications, and fierce competition at every level. Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users; that’s an amazing achievement. But we can’t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service, or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users.

We all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression. Once you are in its enclosed online space, it is the corporation’s terms of service, not the First Amendment, that determines what you can say. If it decides to downplay speech it doesn’t like, Facebook has the right to do so.

So I’m glad that conservatives are concerned, even if the allegations prove overblown. (Facebook has modified its outright denial to a “we’re looking into it” stance; stay tuned.) I’d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition — and that we’re in uncharted information-freedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon Valley.

right wing is in a froth about allegations that facebook has tweaked its trending news feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites its not clear if the allegations from a gizmodo report based on anonymous sources are true and facebook denies them but the deeper problem is undeniably real facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities  corporate and governmental  that are gaining control over news freedom of expression and much of our digital lives the irony is that the conservatives and businessbacked republicans in congress who howl about facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control almost no one wants to address the fact that facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word along with google it dominates online advertising facebook especially does so on mobile devices which are the way many people connect to the internet if you offer news and information online you have almost no choice but to play on facebooks field because so much of your audience is there in some parts of the world facebook essentially is the internet because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and or governments facebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition instagram whatsapp oculus this is smart  no one can dispute that mark zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists  but its also a red flag as zuckerberg famously said several years ago he wants facebook to be like electricity well electricity is a utility and we regulate utilities monopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members they end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition its their nature which is why capitalism plainly the best system when its working right needs rules to promote competition yet republicans in general think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition they consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive at best  except of course when a powerful constituent a corporation usually is in danger from predatory behavior that attitude accounts for the gops cheerleading for corporate dominance of internet access republicans in general are fine with the idea that one or two companies say the leading cable provider and another telecom should control access in most communities and utterly opposed to a remedy  what we call network neutrality  to ensure that people at the edges of networks not dominant internet service providers should decide what information they want and at what priority i dont want the government to tell facebook what it can publish and dont look forward to much more than posturing from congress but i do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online i want government to use antitrust and other procompetition laws to ensure that facebook doesnt abuse its dominance in a business sense i want governments to promote open technology and communications and fierce competition at every level kudos to zuckerberg for making facebook so appealing to millions of users thats an amazing achievement but we cant allow

3648.0,FBI checking if Orlando shooter's wife knew attack plan but didn't warn police,"The wife of the gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting on American soil could face criminal charges if investigators conclude that she knew of the attack in advance but failed to warn police.

Noor Zahi Salman told that FBI that her husband, Omar Mateen, had said he was going out to see friends, but she feared he was going to attack a gay nightclub, NBC News reported on Wednesday. She tried to talk him out of it but did not contact law enforcement agencies.

Wielding an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a handgun, Mateen opened fire at the Pulse club in Orlando, Florida, early on Sunday in a three-hour shooting rampage and hostage siege that ended when a Swat team smashed its way in and killed him. There were 49 people killed and 53 were injured.

Angus King, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, which received a briefing on the attack, told CNN: “It appears she [Salman] had some knowledge of what was going on. She definitely is, I guess you would say, a person of interest right now and appears to be cooperating and can provide us with some important information.”

Peter King, chairman of the House homeland security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism, told MSNBC: “If it’s true that she did know that it was going to happen and she tried to talk him out of it, then it’s possible criminal action (could be taken) against her, and again there might be more involvement by her, so all that has to be investigated.”

The possibility that Mateen, 29, did not act alone but received support from other individuals or groups is now central to the FBI’s inquiry, King added. “If there’s anybody else that he was dealing with, anyone else he was talking with, anyone else who may have known about this, this is all where the investigation is going now.”

Media reports also suggested that Salman was with her husband when he bought ammunition and a holster. She allegedly told the FBI that she once drove him to Pulse, nearly a two-hour drive from their home in Fort Pierce, Florida, because he wanted to scope it out. Mateen is said to have browsed militant Islamist material on the internet for at least two years before the mass shooting.

As detectives tried to piece together Mateen’s last movements on Saturday night, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer, who opened a family assistance centre in a stadium on Wednesday, said: “What I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations.”

The FBI director, James Comey, has said the agency is trying to determine whether Mateen had recently visited Disney World, one of the Orlando’s celebrated theme parks, to consider it as a potential target.

Disney, which is donating $1m to an official fund for victims of the shooting, installed metal detectors last December but declined to comment on the Mateen case. A spokesperson said: “Unfortunately we’ve all been living in a world of uncertainty, and we have been increasing our security measures across our properties for some time, adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers, additional canine units, and law enforcement officers on site, as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.”

Salman will be key to the ongoing investigation as conflicting narratives emerge, including evidence he had been influenced by militant Islamist ideas and reports he might have struggled with his own sexual identity.

A survivor of the massacre, Patience Carter, suggested on Tuesday that Mateen had an overt political motive. Cowering in a bathroom, she heard him demand that Americans “stop bombing his country” and pledge allegiance to Islamic State, she said.

Carter, 20, who is African American, told reporters at Florida Hospital: “He even spoke to us directly in the bathroom. He said, ‘Are there any black people in here?’ I was too afraid to answer but there was an African American male in the stall, where the majority of my body was, who had answered and he said, ‘Yes, there are about six or seven of us,’ and the gunman responded back to him and said: ‘You know, I don’t have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.’”

The account chimed with previous FBI statements that Mateen had called the 911 emergency service and made reference to both Isis and the Tsarnaev brothers, who were responsible for the Boston bombings. Investigators have said Mateen was probably self-radicalised and there is no evidence that he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Isis.

Mateen also called a local 24-hour cable news channel, News 13, the station revealed on its website on Wednesday. Matthew Gentili, who was the producer on duty at the time, recalled that Mateen said: “I’m the shooter. It’s me. I am the shooter ... I did it for Isis. I did it for the Islamic State.”

Soon after the attack, Mateen’s father indicated that his son had strong anti-gay feelings. He recounted an incident when his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami while out with his wife and young son.

Several media reports quoted men as saying they had seen Mateen at Pulse many times or that he had contacted them via gay dating apps, such as Grindr and Jack’d. But Pulse denied that he had ever been a patron. “Untrue and totally ridiculous,” spokeswoman Sara Brady said in an email to Reuters.

Mateen’s ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, told CNN she did not know if he was gay but added: “Well, when we had gotten married, he confessed to me about his past that was recent at that time and that he very much enjoyed going to clubs and the nightlife and there was a lot of pictures of him.”

“I feel like it’s a side of him or a part of him that he lived but probably didn’t want everybody to know about.”

Asked by the Guardian about rumours his son was gay, Mateen’s father Seddique Mateen said: “It’s not true. Why, if he was gay, would he do this?”

Seddique Mateen declined to comment specifically on the investigation on Wednesday, saying: “The FBI, they always do a professional job and to the maximum extent of my ability I will support them.”

Mateen, investigated twice by the FBI, was on the government’s terrorist watchlist for 10 months before being taken off. G4S, the security company that employed Mateen, only psychologically evaluated him once, at the start of his nine-year employment with the company and not again after the company was made aware he had been interviewed by the FBI.

Thirty-three people remain in hospital, including six in critical condition. On Tuesday, the first of the seriously injured to speak of their trauma was Angel Colon at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. “He’s shooting everyone that’s already dead on the floor, making sure they’re dead,” he said, speaking from a wheelchair. “I look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And I’m just there laying down and I’m thinking: ‘I’m next, I’m dead.’



“So I don’t know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he won’t know that I’m alive.”

The attending trauma surgeon on call that night, Dr Chadwick Smith, said: “It was singularly the worst day of my career and the best day of my career. And I think you can say that of pretty much every person standing up here.”

The atrocity continued to reverberate in Washington DC, where Senate Democrats demanded tighter gun controls. Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, broke ranks with the party by saying he would meet the influential National Rifle Association lobbying group, which has endorsed him, to discuss an idea for restricting gun purchases by people on terrorism watchlists.

Barack Obama, who will visit Orlando on Thursday, launched a blistering assault against Trump over the candidate’s anti-Muslim rhetoric, which the president described as dangerous and contrary to American values.

“Where does this stop? The Orlando killer, one of the San Bernardino killers, the Fort Hood killer, [they] were all US citizens. Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? ...

596.0,Handicapping the Hispanic vote for 2016 GOPers,"The last Texas Republican to occupy the Oval Office, George W. Bush, took 49 percent of the state’s Hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential re-election, setting a relatively high bar for the handful of Texas-born or -raised Republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016.

Republican presidential aspirants with ties to the Lone Star State must figure out how to hold the GOP base and attract conservative Hispanics if they want to be successful in Texas, political observers say.

So how do the party's four most prominent Texas affiliated might-be candidates — former Gov. Rick Perry; Jeb Bush, the son and brother of two former presidents from the state; Texas’ junior U.S. senator, Ted Cruz; and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky — stack up in the early going?

For Republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012, when presidential nominee Mitt Romney took only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide, they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into Hispanic communities and truly connect with voters, said Hector De Leon, co-chairman of the Associated Republicans of Texas, which reaches out to Hispanic voters.

“It’s all about paying attention,” De Leon said.

Hispanics made up 10 percent of the national electorate in the 2012 presidential election. But in Texas, they make up almost one-third of eligible voters. And there’s plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout. Only 39 percent of Texas Hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012.

Political observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of George W. Bush’s playbook on Hispanic outreach. He solidified his winning record with Hispanics with help from Latino-media guru Lionel Sosa, who told The Texas Tribune he has been in talks with Jeb Bush about his possible presidential bid.

Sosa helped George W. Bush’s campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood Hispanic culture. The candidate who can mobilize on-the-fence Hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the state.

“I do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency,” said Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions. “In Texas, that’s 10 million people. That’s a number that cannot be ignored.”

Though it's still early in the game, many political observers say Jeb Bush is best positioned at the moment. He grew up in Midland, spent much of his childhood in Houston and is considered friendly to the Hispanic community, both personally and politically.

“Jeb Bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics,” Manzano said. “He knows better than that.”

But this far out, all is speculation. As the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate, here's how several political experts handicap the field.

Already holding a political advantage because he is fluent in Spanish, the former Florida governor has experience winning over Hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population. During his 1998 re-election campaign, Bush won an impressive 61 percent of Florida's Hispanic electorate. It's worth noting, though, that Florida’s mostly Cuban Hispanic population differs from Texas, where a majority of Hispanics have roots in Mexico.

What the experts say:

For Bush, reaching out to Texas Hispanics would be an extended family affair. Aside from benefiting from the groundwork his family has done in the state, expect to see Bush campaigning with his Mexican-born wife, Columba, and his son, Texas Land CommissionerGeorge P. Bush, at his side. George P. is also fluent in Spanish and helped found Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a political group that recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for public office.

Bush’s record on issues that resonate with Texas Hispanics, particularly immigration reform, could prove attractive to this voting group. He has urged Congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as a key issue in helping Republicans win Hispanics. He also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an “act of love” for their families.

As the state’s longest-serving governor, Perry has long courted Texas Hispanics. He has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the Hispanic vote when he defeated Hispanic businessman Tony Sanchez of Laredo in 2002. By the time he was re-elected in 2010, Perry pulled in 38 percent of Hispanic voters.

What the experts say:

Perry’s efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the Texas Dream Act during his 14-year tenure. Though the future of the law granting in-state tuition to some undocumented immigrants is unclear, Perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home. During a 2011 presidential debate, Perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart. More recently, as the state’s new GOP leadership works to overturn the law, Perry has been vocal about his continued support for it.

Because he presided over the state’s economic boom in the last decade, Perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to Hispanics on economic issues. If Perry can convince Hispanic voters that they benefited from the so-called Texas Miracle, he may be able to sway some on-the-fence voters his way.

Though he is the only Hispanic in the group — and the first Hispanic senator from Texas — Cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his father’s journey to the United States from Cuban as an exile in 1957. Still, he has done well with Texas Hispanics. In 2012, he outperformed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, taking 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a Latino Decisions poll.

What the experts say:

Cruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting Texas Hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care. He has been vocal in his opposition to President Obama’s executive order on immigration, which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings. The order is widely popular among Hispanics. On health care, Cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal Affordable Care Act. Texas Hispanics — who make up a large portion of the state’s uninsured population —overwhelmingly support the health law.

Though Paul was elected to the Senate from Kentucky, where Hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population, he grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, where Hispanics are one-fifth of the population. Paul has spent the last few months preaching a message of Hispanic inclusion within the Republican ranks.

What the experts say:

Paul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to Texas Hispanics because of his views on growing the GOP’s number of Hispanic supporters. Because he is largely unknown among Texas Hispanics, Paul also has some room to improve his standing. A November 2014 poll by Latino Decisions found that almost a third of Texas Latino voters have no opinion of Paul.",REAL,the last texas republican to occupy the oval office george w bush took  percent

6061.0,Truth Will Out Radio: The Laconia Incident,"Radio Aryan October 28, 2016 
Sven Longshanks , Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt bring us another episode of Truth Will Out Radio, this week looking at the Laconia incident and the British Freikorps. 
Messerschmitt deviates somewhat with his Axis War Heroes series in that the main subject is not a person but the so-called “Laconia Incident”. In September 1942 a German U-boat under the Command of Werner Hartenstein torpedoed the British troopship Laconia. As Hartenstein realized that a lot of Italian prisoners of war and even civilians including women and children were among the survivors struggling for their lives he ordered that as many as possible were to be taken on board the U-boat. Even though he radioed his intentions to all surrounding vessels in plain English and had a Red Cross flag draped across the U-boat he and the survivors they were carrying were attacked by an American B-24. What happened to the survivors and what the response of the German Navy was when it learned of this atrocity is elaborated on by Schmitt and the presentation ends with a letter from a relative of one of the casualties, thanking the U-boat commanders for their courageous and honourable behaviour. 
This presentation shows how the Allies were breaking the rules of war while the Germans were keeping to their treaties. During the Nuremberg trials this incident was brought up in the hopes of convicting Admiral Doenitz for advising the U-boats not to pick up survivors, but it had the inadvertent effect of exposing the British and Americans of waging unrestricted submarine warfare, in itself a possible war crime as it breaks the law of the sea that any shipwrecked mariners must be rescued, no matter who they are. Dennis points out the hypocrisy of the British and Americans in this before reminding us that not all the British behaved like this during the war. Some became members of the Freikorps and fought to defend Europe from the Bolshevik menace alongside the other SS Volunteer Legions. These heroes were called traitors by the British establishment, yet their oath was to protect Europe from Communism, not to fight against Britain. It is a testament to the truthful ideology of National Socialism that prisoners of war could be set free to fight against Communism once they had heard the truth about it from their kinsmen in the League of St George. 
After giving us a brief history of these brave young British men, Dennis and Sven conclude the podcast by talking about the importance of race and how the Freikorps highlighted this in their propaganda.

1569.0,GOP establishment nightmare? Ted Cruz vs. Donald Trump,"Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday, December 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET.

The GOP establishment, confronted by a recalcitrant electorate that refuses to leave Donald Trump, is being forced to take a fresh look at Ted Cruz , a man with grassroots strength in key early primary states and few friends in Washington.

Suddenly, the Republican Party's best hope could be a man hell-bent on transforming it: a senator who openly spars with fellow GOP colleagues, and has campaigned by painting its leaders as spineless and feeble.

Headed into Tuesday's CNN Republican presidential debate, Cruz and Trump have turned Iowa into a two-man race, with the Texan leading in two new polls. Cruz is up 31% to Trump's 21% among likely GOP caucus-goers, according to the Bloomberg Politics-Des Moines Register poll released Saturday. A Fox News poll Sunday has Cruz leading Trump 28% to 26%.

A small and growing number of Republicans allied with the establishment -- the force long thought to quickly consolidate against a surging Cruz bid -- are coming to terms with the idea that he may be palatable in an election cycle where Trump has pushed the envelope well beyond what they considered acceptable.

""Oh God, yes,"" said Ed Rogers, a top Republican lobbyist, when asked if he'd prefer Cruz. ""Compared to Trump, he's OK.""

Establishment Republicans had enough of a problem when Trump began his populist-fueled move to the top of national polls, where he has stubbornly remained for five months. But Cruz's steady rise means that even if Trump were taken out by a well-financed negative campaign, they might have to deal with a stronger Cruz, who has more political polish than the more improvisational Trump.

""If you talk to my peers around town, collectively it's an appreciation the guy is smart as hell,"" explained a senior Washington Republican who is backing another candidate. ""He can be a more acceptable alternative to Trump, if it comes to that.""

The irony hasn't escaped them. Said the Republican: ""It's an interesting life -- and everything's relative.""

""The second he starts to look like a winner in Washington,"" Rogers said, ""he's going to have a bunch of new friends.""

It's a dilemma swatted away on Capitol Hill -- perhaps optimistically.

Asked about choosing Trump or Cruz, 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain would only allow that they are ""smart people."" Bush backer Sen. Susan Collins would just offer that they are ""obviously not my choice.""

And there's no guarantee either one can beat Hillary Clinton.

""He's not as outrageous as Trump, but I don't know that he's any more electable than Trump,"" said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Republican presidential campaigns for over two decades.

Brian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide, said it's an out-of-control Trump -- not an in-control Cruz -- that explains the Texan's growing appeal.

""Trump has gone so far that it has in some ways masked how problematic Cruz would be as the nominee as well,"" he said.

Despite his background as an Ivy League-educated attorney and his time in the Bush administration, Cruz rose to prominence as a tea party darling who became the national face of the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz has spent the two years since working to salvage his relationship with some potential investors in his campaign, but he has reveled in his image as a Washington bad boy, the only senator willing to do on Capitol Hill what he campaigned on back at home.

It's something that has made him enemies in Washington, where he has not convinced a single Senate colleague to back his campaign. Cruz helped push Republicans to shut down the government in a high-stakes fight over Obamacare, a strategy that failed to get results but didn't cause a predicted electoral meltdown.

On the trail, he has shown no willingness to moderate his positions, bragging about his conservative purity and his rabble-rousing reputation in the Capitol.

But even compared to Cruz's burn-it-down rhetoric, Trump's campaign has been more incendiary and worrisome for party elders determined to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The mogul had harsh things to say about Hispanics, prisoners of war, women in the media, the disabled, and most recently, Muslims, who he thinks temporarily should not be allowed to enter the United States.

And most concerning for GOP leaders, Trump has frequently floated leaving the Republican Party altogether to mount an independent bid, which would significantly increase Clinton's chances of winning the White House.

The pair appears to be heading toward a clash that Cruz, at least, long sought to delay. On Friday evening, about 24 hours after audio leaked of Cruz questioning Trump's judgment at a private fundraiser, the real estate mogul launched his first attacks on Cruz.

Cruz had attempted to head that off by alleging that mainstream Republicans were trying to sow discord.

""The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,"" he tweeted Friday morning. ""Sorry to disappoint — @realdonaldtrump is terrific. #DealWithIt""

Cruz has done little to woo the Republicans he used as his bogeyman: He has raised the lion's share of his money far from the New York-to-Washington corridor, raced to the party's right flank on every issue of the day, and campaigned loudly on the polarizing social issues that one well-placed Republican said puts some contributors permanently out of reach.

Cruz, on paper, should not be as repellent to the GOP political class as he is. Nurtured by the George W. Bush network in Texas, he served as solicitor general before winning an upset bid in the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate primary.

To Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, that resume should theoretically make him attractive to the party's elite.

""At a core of Cruz's candidacy is a great phonyism,"" Stevens said of the self-stylized insurgent. ""You can wear all the plaid shirts and shoot off all the automatic weapons you want, but you're an insider.""

And some of his positions, such as on national security, do hew closely to the party's center. As Cruz held court on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" last week, ""you could've sworn he was working for George Herbert Walker Bush on his foreign policy,"" a senior Republican said.

But a leading Republican in frequent touch with high-level donors, said even though those contributors may despise Cruz, they are learning to live with him. ""If that's what we need to do to beat Trump,"" the Republican said, ""then that's what you get.""",REAL,watch the cnn republican debate tuesday december  at  pm et and  pm et the gop establishment

1178.0,Bernie Sanders lost poor voters in South Carolina by a big margin — a problem for his political revolution,"Hillary Clinton didn't just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders's strongest arguments — that he's the candidate who has the most working-class support.

In Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his ""political revolution"" could energize millions of new low-income voters who typically don't turn out to vote.

This argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight. Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina, taking 82 percent of those who earn under $30,000 on her way to a 37-point victory, according to exit polling by the New York Times.

Here are the results by income, according to the Times:

Of course, this discrepancy is largely driven by Clinton's huge 87-13 margin of victory over black voters. But that's the point — outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire, many low-income and working-class voters aren't white. Unless Sanders is able to win working-class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country, his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started.",REAL,hillary clinton didnt just take the vast majority of the available delegates in south carolina on saturday night she also took away one of bernie sanderss strongest arguments  that hes the candidate who has the most workingclass support in iowa and new hampshire sanders had done better than clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets that seemed to bolster his claim that his political revolution could energize millions of new lowincome voters who typically dont turn out to vote this argument however is much less tenable after tonight clinton did best among poor voters in south carolina taking  percent of those who earn under  on her way to a point victory according to exit polling by the new york times here are the results by income according to the times of course this discrepancy is largely driven by clintons huge  margin of victory over black voters but thats the point  outside of states like iowa and new hampshire many lowincome and workingclass voters arent white unless sanders is able to win workingclass voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started,"['hillary', 'clinton', 'didnt', 'take', 'vast', 'majority', 'available', 'delegates', 'south', 'carolina', 'saturday', 'night', 'also', 'took', 'away', 'one', 'bernie', 'sanderss', 'strongest', 'arguments', 'hes', 'candidate', 'workingclass', 'support', 'iowa', 'new', 'hampshire', 'sanders', 'done', 'better', 'clinton', 'among', 'voters', 'lowest', 'income', 'brackets', 'seemed', 'bolster', 'claim', 'political', 'revolution', 'could', 'energize', 'millions', 'new', 'lowincome', 'voters', 'typically', 'dont', 'turn', 'vote', 'argument', 'however', 'much', 'less', 'tenable', 'tonight', 'clinton', 'best', 'among', 'poor', 'voters', 'south', 'carolina', 'taking', 'percent', 'earn', 'way', 'point', 'victory', 'according', 'exit', 'polling', 'new', 'york', 'times', 'results', 'income', 'according', 'times', 'course', 'discrepancy', 'largely', 'driven', 'clintons', 'huge', 'margin', 'victory', 'black', 'voters', 'thats', 'point', 'outside', 'states', 'like', 'iowa', 'new', 'hampshire', 'many', 'lowincome', 'workingclass', 'voters', 'arent', 'white', 'unless', 'sanders', 'able', 'win', 'workingclass', 'voters', 'beyond', 'whitest', 'electorates', 'country', 'revolution', 'may', 'almost', 'soon', 'started']","['PERSON', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'CARDINAL', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'TIME', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'GPE']","{'GPE': 6, 'PERSON': 3, 'TIME': 2, 'CARDINAL': 2, 'ORG': 2, 'DATE': 1}",2,3,6,192,0.21236858379715523,30

I think that maybe she can use a very natural makeup as an enhancement for her features to make her skin look softer and fresher. More than those lines her skin looks tired. Exfoliation, hydration, and a natural makeup will do a great difference in her.﻿ November 1, 2016 at 6:25 am 
Botox is a toxin, it's not for ""taking care of your skin"". If you want to actually take care of your skin and reduce the appearance of your wrinkles, you should do a deep chemical peel once a year, derma roll every month, and use prescription Retin-A in between those things. Keeping the skin hydrated and nourished with consistent exfoliation is the key to young skin. So vitamin e oil, steam facials and natural moisturizers on the regular. As far as feminism and skincare/plastic surgery, I think it's less a gender issue than a reach to maintain biological attraction. Youth equals fertility, and – because we're animals – to attract a mate, generally it's about how ""fertile"" you appear. Call it peacocking or whatever you will, it's not anti-feminist to care about how you look.﻿",FAKE,support us should i get botox source add to the conversation using facebook comments november   at  am i think that maybe she can use a very natural makeup as an enhancement for her features to make her skin look softer and fresher more than those lines her skin looks tired exfoliation hydration and a natural makeup will do a great difference in her november   at  am botox is a toxin its not for taking care of your skin if you want to actually take care of your skin and reduce the appearance of your wrinkles you should do a deep chemical peel once a year derma roll every month and use prescription retina in between those things keeping the skin hydrated and nourished with consistent exfoliation is the key to young skin so vitamin e oil steam facials and natural moisturizers on the regular as far as feminism and skincareplastic surgery i think its less a gender issue than a reach to maintain biological attraction youth equals fertility and  because were animals  to attract a mate generally its about how fertile you appear call it peacocking or whatever you will its not antifeminist to care about how you look,"['support', 'us', 'get', 'botox', 'source', 'add', 'conversation', 'using', 'facebook', 'comments', 'november', 'think', 'maybe', 'use', 'natural', 'makeup', 'enhancement', 'features', 'make', 'skin', 'look', 'softer', 'fresher', 'lines', 'skin', 'looks', 'tired', 'exfoliation', 'hydration', 'natural', 'makeup', 'great', 'difference', 'november', 'botox', 'toxin', 'taking', 'care', 'skin', 'want', 'actually', 'take', 'care', 'skin', 'reduce', 'appearance', 'wrinkles', 'deep', 'chemical', 'peel', 'year', 'derma', 'roll', 'every', 'month', 'use', 'prescription', 'retina', 'things', 'keeping', 'skin', 'hydrated', 'nourished', 'consistent', 'exfoliation', 'key', 'young', 'skin', 'vitamin', 'e', 'oil', 'steam', 'facials', 'natural', 'moisturizers', 'regular', 'far', 'feminism', 'skincareplastic', 'surgery', 'think', 'less', 'gender', 'issue', 'reach', 'maintain', 'biological', 'attraction', 'youth', 'equals', 'fertility', 'animals', 'attract', 'mate', 'generally', 'fertile', 'appear', 'call', 'peacocking', 'whatever', 'antifeminist', 'care', 'look']","['DATE', 'DATE', 'DATE']",{'DATE': 3},0,0,0,199,0.10422222222222223,83
1506.0,Jeb Bush Picks Up Endorsement From Lindsey Graham,"Former GOP presidential hopeful Linsdey Graham has announced his endorsement of Jeb Bush for president.

Graham's presidential campaign went nowhere, but as a senator from the early voting state of South Carolina he hopes to still have some clout.

Graham praised Bush's temperament Friday morning, following Thursday night's GOP debate. ""He hasn't tried to get ahead in a contested primary by embracing demagoguery ... he's not running to be commander-in-chief by running people down,"" he said.

That was clearly a reference to Donald Trump. Bush returned the admiration, calling Graham a ""patriot.""

""He loves this country. You just hear it how he spoke from his heart about what's at stake here. What's at stake is our way of life,"" Bush said.

Jeb Bush — still slumping in polls — has been looking for a way to jump-start his campaign, but an endorsement from a former candidate who couldn't break through either probably won't give Bush the upswing he needs.

With the Iowa caucuses fewer than three weeks away, he's polling behind Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson both nationally and in Iowa. Bush was unable to stand out from the field once again at Thursday's Republican presidential debate. And Bush's donors are reportedly getting skittish, saying it's only a matter of time before he drops out. Politico reported that several donors said they are now waiting for what one former George W.

1641.0,"2016 Republican race enters a new, volatile phase","The fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination appears to be moving into a new, more fluid phase.

No longer is the question merely whether or how Donald Trump can be stopped.

The recent rise in the polls of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — Trump’s low-key stylistic opposite — has shown that the celebrity billionaire may not be the only one who can tap the appetite of many in the party’s angry base for an outsider.

And after Wednesday’s chaotic and freewheeling debate, there also is a new dynamic on the establishment side of the race.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s once-formidable campaign appears to be nearing a state of collapse, made worse by his flailing on the stage in Colorado.

That has provided an opening to his onetime ally, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is getting a new look from the party establishment — an ironic situation, given Rubio’s roots as an insurgent tea party favorite in 2010.

“Marco Rubio now has probably the best shot to emerge as the mainstream alternative to Trump and Carson,” said Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary for President George W. Bush.

More broadly, Fleischer, who is not committed to any of the 2016 candidates, predicted that the GOP is about to enter “a condensed version of where it was four years ago, where the party is volatile and shopping around.”

That could help Ted Cruz, who also made a strong showing in the debate. The firebrand senator from Texas, widely despised by the Washington Republican hierarchy, is looking to nudge out Trump and Carson among voters who are looking for a candidate to supplant the old order.

“I don’t think the party is going to nominate anybody who has not been elected before,” said Stuart Stevens, who was a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

Also likely to force some clarity in the coming weeks is the calendar. The first contest, in Iowa, is barely more than three months away.

So the focus for all the leading contenders will have to shift, from raising their profiles nationally to refining the strategies and organization it will take to put specific states in their column.

“The campaign is really in a nuts-and-bolts stage,” said Trump’s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. “It’s about getting on the ballot, organizing, and making sure people understand what caucuses are in Iowa and other states and teach them how to participate. It’s about getting people committed and ready.”

Lewandowski said Trump’s campaign is already hiring staff for states that do not hold their primaries until March.

“Our approach is to execute and meet the criteria to get on the ballot in all 50 states, in five territories and in the District of Columbia. That’s a full-time job,” he added. “This campaign is doing all of the things necessary for long-term success.”

At the same time, Trump seemed to be moderating and refining his message as he campaigned outside Reno, Nev., Thursday afternoon.

Where he previously has devoted his rallies to slinging insults at his opponents and boasting about his poll numbers, Trump focused instead on describing the professional and life experience he would bring to the White House.

He also cited issues where he claimed to have led before it was a popular thing to do — including opposing the Iraq war and aggressively combating illegal immigration.

“That’s the kind of thinking we need in the country,” Trump said. “A lot of the people in the audience, maybe in your small way you have that same thinking.”

Bush, campaigning in New Hampshire, insisted that his struggling candidacy should not be counted out. The former Florida governor, who is polling in the single digits almost everywhere, insisted, “We’re doing fine.”

But he appeared to acknowledge that he had not helped his prospects with his showing in the debate.

“Look, there are two types of politicians. There are the talkers and there are the doers,” Bush told the crowd. “I wish I could talk as well as some of the people on the stage, the big personalities on the stage, but I’m a doer.”

Rubio, meanwhile, must capi­tal­ize — quickly — on whatever interest and momentum may be generated by his debate performance. He spent the morning making the rounds of six network and cable television shows and the remainder of the day fundraising in Denver and Chicago. He will be in Iowa on Friday.

On “CBS This Morning,” Rubio declined to criticize Bush personally and said the differences between the two will be fleshed out in terms of policy.

“I’m going to continue to tell people who I am, what I’m for. There are policy differences between us — we’ll discuss those. Americans deserve to hear those. But I’m not going to change my campaign,” he said.

“Jeb is my friend, I have admiration for him. I’m not running against him. I’m running for president.”

Cruz, meanwhile, is building what GOP insiders say is a strong organization. The campaign says that it has 77,000 volunteers on the ground, with 6,000 in the first four voting states.

Fundraising has also been robust — and was reignited by the debate, during which the senator trained his fire on the CNBC moderators and the media. A Cruz aide said more than $1 million had poured in since Wednesday night’s debate.

There will be growing pressure on candidates who are getting no traction to get out of the race. On Thursday, for instance, the New York Times editorial board called upon New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to abandon his bid.

“New Jersey is in trouble, and the governor is off pursuing a presidential run that’s turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project,” the paper wrote. “Mr. Christie’s numbers are in the basement, and he’s nearly out of campaign cash. This is his moment, all right: to go home and use the rest of his term to clean out the barn, as Speaker John Boehner would say.”

Christie, for his part, tweeted, “Can’t read the article because I don’t have a subscription, but I can tell you this — I am not going anywhere.”

139.0,"‘Hands up, don’t shoot’ was built on a lie","The late evening of Aug. 9, 2014, I couldn’t sleep. I was due to substitute-anchor MSNBC’s “UP with Steve Kornacki” and should have been asleep. But after looking at my Twitter feed and reading the rage under #Ferguson, I felt compelled to type a reaction to the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Tying the shooting to the inane whine of certain politicians about a “war on whites,”  I decried the next morning the death of yet another unarmed black man at the hands of a white police officer.

In those early hours and early days, there was more unknown than known. But this month, the Justice Department released two must-read investigations connected to the killing of Brown that filled in blanks, corrected the record and brought sunlight to dark places by revealing ugly practices that institutionalized racism and hardship. They have also forced me to deal with two uncomfortable truths: Brown never surrendered with his hands up, and Wilson was justified in shooting Brown.

The report on the Ferguson police department detailed abuse and blatant trampling of the constitutional rights of people, mostly African Americans, in Ferguson. Years of mistreatment by the police, the courts and the municipal government, including evidence that all three balanced their books on the backs of the people of Ferguson, were laid bare in 102 damning pages. The overwhelming data from DOJ provided background and much-needed context for why a small St. Louis suburb most had never heard of exploded the moment Brown was killed. His death gave voice to many who suffered in silence.

The unarmed 18-year-old also became a potent symbol of the lack of trust between African Americans and law enforcement. Not just in Ferguson, but in the rest of the country. Lord knows there have been plenty of recent examples. And the militarized response to protesters by local police put an exclamation point on demonstrators’ concerns. But the other DOJ report, the one on the actual shooting of Michael Brown, shows him to be an inappropriate symbol.

Through exhaustive interviews with witnesses, cross-checking their statements with previous statements to authorities and the media, ballistics, DNA evidence and results from three autopsies, the Justice Department was able to present a credible and troubling picture of what happened on Canfield Drive. More credible than the grand jury decision to not indict Wilson. The transcript of his grand jury testimony read like so much hand-holding by the prosecution.

What DOJ found made me ill. Wilson knew about the theft of the cigarillos from the convenience store and had a description of the suspects. Brown fought with the officer and tried to take his gun. And the popular hands-up storyline, which isn’t corroborated by ballistic and DNA evidence and multiple witness statements, was perpetuated by Witness 101. In fact, just about everything said to the media by Witness 101, whom we all know as Dorian Johnson, the friend with Brown that day, was not supported by the evidence and other witness statements.

Page 6: Brown then grabbed the weapon and struggled with Wilson to gain control of it. Wilson fired, striking Brown in the hand. Autopsy results and bullet trajectory, skin from Brown’s palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brown’s DNA on the inside of the driver’s door corroborate Wilson’s account that during the struggle, Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilson’s gun. According to three autopsies, Brown sustained a close range gunshot wound to the fleshy portion of his right hand at the base of his right thumb. Soot from the muzzle of the gun found embedded in the tissue of this wound coupled with indicia of thermal change from the heat of the muzzle indicate that Brown’s hand was within inches of the muzzle of Wilson’s gun when it was fired. The location of the recovered bullet in the side panel of the driver’s door, just above Wilson’s lap, also corroborates Wilson’s account of the struggle over the gun and when the gun was fired, as do witness accounts that Wilson fired at least one shot from inside the SUV.

Page 8: Although there are several individuals who have stated that Brown held his hands up in an unambiguous sign of surrender prior to Wilson shooting him dead, their accounts do not support a prosecution of Wilson. As detailed throughout this report, some of those accounts are inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence; some of those accounts are materially inconsistent with that witness’s own prior statements with no explanation, credible [or] otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time. Certain other witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts, admitting that they did not witness the shooting or parts of it, despite what they initially reported either to federal or local law enforcement or to the media. Prosecutors did not rely on those accounts when making a prosecutive decision. While credible witnesses gave varying accounts of exactly what Brown was doing with his hands as he moved toward Wilson – i.e., balling them, holding them out, or pulling up his pants up – and varying accounts of how he was moving – i.e., “charging,” moving in “slow motion,” or “running” – they all establish that Brown was moving toward Wilson when Wilson shot him. Although some witnesses state that Brown held his hands up at shoulder level with his palms facing outward for a brief moment, these same witnesses describe Brown then dropping his hands and “charging” at Wilson.

The DOJ report notes on page 44 that Johnson “made multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that Wilson shot Brown execution-style as he held up his hands in surrender.” In one of those interviews, Johnson told MSNBC that Brown was shot in the back by Wilson. It was then that Johnson said Brown stopped, turned around with his hands up and said, “I don’t have a gun, stop shooting!” And, like that, “hands up, don’t shoot” became the mantra of a movement. But it was wrong, built on a lie.

Yet this does not diminish the importance of the real issues unearthed in Ferguson by Brown’s death. Nor does it discredit what has become the larger “Black Lives Matter.” In fact, the false Ferguson narrative stuck because of concern over a distressing pattern of other police killings of unarmed African American men and boys around the time of Brown’s death. Eric Garner was killed on a Staten Island street on July 17. John Crawford III was killed in a Wal-Mart in Beavercreek, Ohio, on Aug. 5, four days before Brown. Levar Jones survived being shot by a South Carolina state trooper on Sept. 4. Tamir Rice, 12 years old, was killed in a Cleveland park on Nov. 23, the day before the Ferguson grand jury opted not to indict Wilson. Sadly, the list has grown longer.

Now that black lives matter to everyone, it is imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others. But we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong. And when we discover that we have, we must acknowledge it, admit our error and keep on marching. That’s what I’ve done here.",REAL,the late evening of aug   i couldnt sleep i was due to substituteanchor msnbcs up with steve kornacki and should have been asleep but after looking at my twitter feed

4134.0,Bernie Sanders' call for ouster of two convention co-chairs rejected,"Democratic National Committee officials on Saturday turned down Bernie Sanders' formal request for the ouster of “aggressive attack surrogates” for Hillary Clinton from key national convention committees.

The campaign announced earlier that it wanted to remove Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy as a co-chairman of the Platform Committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank as head of the Rules Committee. Frank has sharply criticized Sanders’ positions on breaking up big banks and Malloy has criticized Sanders on guns.

“Governor Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,” Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch wrote in a letter to the party’s Rules and Bylaws Committee. “Their criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign.""

But committee co-chairs Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller responded that his challenge ""fails to meet the criteria"" for their dismissal. It did not allege any violations in the conduct of their elections to their posts by the DNC executive committee in January, they wrote.

The Sanders campaign’s Friday letter to Democratic National Committee rules officials marks the latest turn in Sanders’ feud with party officials. It comes a week after Sanders said he would make sure Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida isn’t reappointed to her role as head of the DNC if he becomes president and he began fundraising for her primary opponent, Tim Canova.

Most members of the convention standing committees — rules, platform and credentials — are awarded to candidates based on the results of those primaries and caucuses. But under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommended co-chairs and a slate of 25 at-large appointments per committee for approval by the party’s executive committee.

In a May 6 letter to Wasserman Schultz, Sanders complained she selected only three of his more than 40 recommendations for committee appointments, and he expressed no confidence in Malloy or Frank, writing their appointments suggest the committees are being established “in an overtly partisan way.”

Deutsch argued Friday that Frank and Malloy can’t be relied upon to perform convention duties fairly “while laboring under such deeply held bias.”

“The appointment of two individuals so outspokenly critical of Sen. Sanders, and so closely affiliated with Secretary Clinton's campaign, raises concerns that two of the three Convention Standing Committees are being constituted in an overtly partisan way designed to exclude meaningful input from supporters of Sen. Sanders' candidacy,” Deutsch wrote.

In April, Tad Devine, Sanders’ senior adviser, said Frank is among surrogates for Hillary Clinton who used Sanders’ remarks to a New York Daily News editorial board on April 1 to promote a story line that questions Sanders’ capacity to be president. Devine pointed to Frank’s April 6 statements on MSNBC that Sanders “confused several things” in his responses to questions about his core issue of breaking up big banks. Frank also said Sanders’ responses to the editorial board were not “coherent.”

Frank said in an April interview with USA TODAY that he would step aside from his co-chairmanship if the Democratic nomination is still uncertain in June and if a Rules Committee decision could be the deciding factor. With Clinton's decisive lead in delegates, that appears unlikely.

A Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman told USA TODAY earlier this month that Malloy agrees with Sanders on many issues. On Saturday, Leigh Appleby said Malloy is committed to a platform and process reflective of the party's diverse viewpoints.

""This year's Democratic platform process is making an unprecedented effort to ensure the process is reflective of the entire party and that every Democrat has an opportunity to have their voice heard in a meaningful way,"" Appleby said in a statement. ""And at the end of the day, Democats will put forward a platform that stands in stark contrast to the hateful, divisive, and dangerous policies of Donald Trump.""",REAL,democratic national committee

earlier that it wanted to remove connecticut gov dannel malloy as a cochairman of the platform committee and former massachusetts rep barney frank as head of the rules committee frank has sharply criticized sanders positions on breaking up big banks and malloy has criticized sanders on guns governor malloy and mr frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the clinton campaign sanders campaign counsel brad deutsch wrote in a letter to the partys rules and bylaws committee their criticisms of sen sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign but committee cochairs jim roosevelt and lorraine miller responded that his challenge fails to meet the criteria for their dismissal it did not allege any violations in the conduct of their elections to their posts by the dnc executive committee in january they wrote the sanders campaigns friday letter to democratic national committee rules officials marks the latest turn in sanders feud with party officials it comes a week after sanders said he would make sure rep debbie wasserman schultz of florida isnt reappointed to her role as head of the dnc if he becomes president and he began fundraising for her primary opponent tim canova most members of the convention standing committees  rules platform and credentials  are awarded to candidates based on the results of those primaries and caucuses but under party rules wasserman schultz recommended cochairs and a slate of  atlarge appointments per committee for approval by the partys executive committee in a may  letter to wasserman schultz sanders complained she selected only three of his more than  recommendations for committee appointments and he expressed no confidence in malloy or frank writing their appointments suggest the committees are being established in an overtly partisan way deutsch argued friday that frank and malloy cant be relied upon to perform convention duties fairly while laboring under such deeply held bias the appointment of two individuals so outspokenly critical of sen sanders and so closely affiliated with secretary clintons campaign raises concerns that two of the three convention standing committees are being constituted in an overtly partisan way designed to exclude meaningful input from supporters of sen sanders candidacy deutsch wrote in april tad devine sanders senior adviser said frank is among surrogates for hillary clinton who used sanders remarks to a new york daily news editorial board on april  to promote a story line that questions sanders capacity to be president devine pointed to franks april  statements on msnbc that sanders confused several things in his responses to questions about his core issue of breaking up big banks frank also said sanders responses to the editorial board were not coherent frank said in an april interview with usa today that he would step aside from his cochairmanship if the democratic nomination is still uncertain in june and if a rules committee decision could be the deciding factor with clintons decisive lead in delegates that appears unlikely a connecticut democratic party spokesman told usa today earlier this month that malloy agrees with sanders on many issues on saturday leigh appleby said malloy is committed to a platform and process reflective of the partys diverse viewpoints this years democratic platform process is making an unprecedented effort to ensure the process is reflective of the entire party and that every democrat has an opportunity to have their voice heard in a meaningful way appleby said in a statement and at the end of the day democats will put forward a platform that stands in stark contrast to the hateful divisive and dangerous policies of donald trump,"['democratic', 'national', 'committee', 'officials', 'saturday', 'turned', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'formal', 'request', 'ouster',

3854.0,"To get around Congress, Obama turns to city halls","WASHINGTON — President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage, paid sick leave and universal pre-kindergarten.

Instead of Capitol Hill, those victories happened in city halls, state houses and county buildings far from Washington.

At least six major cities — Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Tacoma, Wash., and Washington, D.C. — have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this year's State of the Union Address. Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage, 17 states and six major cities have taken action, including Los Angeles last week.

Obama's state-and-local strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition. Though previous administrations have appointed top advisers to listen to concerns of state and local officials, the Obama White House appears to be the first to aggressively use those same channels to encourage them to adopt Obama's policies.

""It is a change in the paradigm, where we used to sit passively by waiting for elected officials to come to us. We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate,"" said Valerie Jarrett, the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs.

""I think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up, and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate,"" Jarrett said in an interview.

Obama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers, so his persuasion is a form of soft power — the ""phone"" part of what Obama has described as a ""pen-and-phone"" strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperation.

He's found fertile ground in Democratic-run cities such as Seattle, where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since April.

""President Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level, and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally,"" Murray said. That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle, which often doesn't get the national attention East Coast cities do. ""The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us. We do other things beside e-commerce and coffee,"" Murray said.

There's also resistance. Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper, Va., and the director of the American City County Exchange, a year-old initiative of the small-government American Legislative Exchange Council.

Russell said states — not cities, not Congress and not the president — should be the primary regulator of labor conditions. Obama, he said, is ""hop-skipping over the states.""

""With the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party, he doesn't have the allies there that he used to,"" Russell said. ""To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising. It's the only allies he really has.""

The strategy has been more effective on some policies than others. Since last September, more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brother's Keeper initiative, a commitment to help boys and young men of color. But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January, only a handful have moved in that direction.

The state-and-local strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies, which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year. ""Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave — 43 million. Think about that,"" Obama said. ""So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.""

That pledge came with a $1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments, which will begin to be awarded this summer.

Obama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a ""Lead on Leave"" tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies. Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago; Perez has been to Portland, Ore., Pawtucket, R.I., St. Petersburg, Fla., and Seattle.

Tuesday, Perez will be in Minneapolis, which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this month.

Perez said it's a mistake to view the state-and-local strategy as separate from a larger effort. ""Our strategy is an all-of-the-above-and-then-some strategy,"" he said.

He said Obama will continue to use executive orders, as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour.

""We want Congress to act, and I'm confident that it's a when question, not an if question. But we're also not going to wait around for Congress to act,"" Perez said.

Although focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obama's presidency, state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017. (That number, which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordingly.)

""That's nothing to sneeze at. That's progress,"" Jarrett said.

San Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006, requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books, according to A Better Balance, a New York-based legal advocacy group that tracks such laws.

A year ago, advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue, said the group's co-president, Sherry Leiwant. After a White House Working Families Summit last year, and again after January's State of the Union Address, there's been an ""explosion"" of interest by state and local lawmakers, she said.

""The White House leadership on this issue has been huge. It's had a real impact,"" Leiwant said. ""That influence on mayors or governors, who are Democrats but haven't paid a lot of attention to this issue, or they want to be pro-business Democrats, this gives them a lot of cover.""

A Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone, but while the government is divided at the national level, ""the best strategy is to go to localities and states.""

A city-by-city strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated. Every state grants different home rule powers to cities — and even different powers to different-sized cities in the same state.

Philadelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to private-sector workers, but Pittsburgh's law applies only to some non-union city workers. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her city's effort ""a lot of momentum,"" but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide law.

There's also pushback from the opposite direction. Last month, the Pennsylvania Senate voted 37-12 to preempt the Philadelphia law, taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governments.

That bill's sponsor, state Sen. John Eichelberger Jr., said it's untenable to have 2,562 municipalities with different labor standards, forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rules.

""Philosophically, I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda, whether it's liberal or conservative or otherwise,"" he said. ""It's just not the place to adopt these policies.""

Obama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments, said Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North Texas.

""I'm really struck by, one, why hasn't anybody thought of this before? And two, this could be a very effective strategy,"" Eshbaugh-Soha said. ""At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and you're not able to break through the gridlock of Congress, I think it's ingenious.""

He's skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who don't support Obama's policies.

Jarrett said the effort is starting to snowball. She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy. As more cities and states have passed those policies, it's emboldened others.

""Success begets success,"" she said. ""What the evidence has begun to show is it's not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay off.""

Indeed, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013. But three weeks after Obama's State of the Union Address this year, Nutter reversed course.

What changed? Nutter said the economy was better, and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passed.

Bill Greenlee, the councilman who sponsored the measure, said Nutter ""completely turned a corner"" on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda. ""I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union, and if you're a Democrat and a supporter of the president's agenda in general, that's gotta have an effect,"" Greenlee said.

Nutter did make a symbolic nod to Obama's influence in signing the paid leave bill: He signed it with a pen Obama gave him — after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill. The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to $12 an hour.",REAL,washington  president obama has quietly racked up a series of

7049.0,Celebrity Deathmatch: Darkmoon Sages Make Their Final Predictions on US Election,"Is Trump the lesser of two evils or are both candidates equally unelectable? 
THE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS: We’ll know who is right tomorrow! 
SARDONICUS (to Flopot) : I know it makes your blood boil to consider the “lesser of two evils” scenario. But LD has always been a conscientious non-voter and is therefore unlikely to be voting for either Trump or Hillary. Nor am I for that matter, since I am a UK resident and do not get to vote in the American elections. 
You really must reconcile yourself, Flopot, to the fact that Hillary is held in such visceral loathing that her millions of haters feel they have no option but to vote for her opponent, Donald Trump, even though they are aware of the Donald’s many faults and his Zionist connections. 
It’s either not voting at all or voting for the lesser of two evils. 
FLOPOT : You don’t understand the meaning of “lesser of two evils”. It is a con trick; it doesn’t exist. Donald will pursue the same globalist wars and cultural revolutions as any other Zionist puppet. It is a meme that exists to get your consent to continue the same evil. 
HARBINGER: Hear hear. Exactly Flopot. As I’ve stated umpteen times, Trump is good cop, Hillary is bad. But sadly, Sardonicus does not see the ‘grand plan’ even though the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carroll Quigley do, both very much part of that process. 
There is not one politician in the west who becomes what they are, without a careful vetting procedure. Classic example is Jeremy Corbin , whom many thought was going to be the saviour of Labour and take it to the Zionists, when he has proven without any shadow of a doubt that he’s a rampant Zionist, even though who goes on pro Palestine marches. 
Trump is a puppet. Clinton is a puppet. May is a puppet. Merkel is a puppet….. There is not ONE politician in the west who isn’t part of the ‘grand plan’ and it’s why everything works according to plan. 
SARDONICUS (to Flopot and Harbinger) : Yes, I understand exactly what both you and Harbinger are saying and I can sympathize with your viewpoint. You are saying there is NO LESSER OF TWO EVILS here since both candidates are EQUALLY EVIL. Because both are Zionists and will deliver a program to further Jewish interests. That’s what you’re saying, right? 
The only difference, as Harbie indicates, is that one of these two candidates is playing the “bad cop” (Hillary) and the other is playing the “good cop” (Trump). So it’s nonsense to vote for the “good cop” as the “lesser of two evils” when both cops are equally evil when the chips are down. 
This is your argument and I can sympathize with it only if you are correct in your initial assumption that Trump has no redeeming features whatever and is a total charlatan and liar who will break every single promise of his if he gets into the White House. 
You are entitled to that assumption, but you are NOT entitled to believe that your assumption is universally shared. Kevin MacDonald certainly doesn’t believe that Trump is a thorough scoundrel who will sell all White America down the river as soon as he is elected. Nor do the thousands of White Nationalists and other White Americans who share MacDonald’s perfectly acceptable and intellectually defensible views. 
These millions of Trump supporters do NOT believe that Trump is an unmitigated scoundrel who will break his promise to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. Trump has said he has no intention of starting a war with Russia. Hillary has made no such promise. Trump has said he will crack down on illegal immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants from hostile Muslim states. Well, MacDonald and his White Nationalists are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. 
I for one refuse to think that Kevin MacDonald and the millions who are hoping for a resurgence of White ethnic interests are deluded and mistaken in their advocacy of Donald Trump. They could be right. Trump could be their man and actually deliver the goods, i.e., improve the lives of millions of White Americans who are now suffering under Jewish hegemony and a multiculturalism that has gone mad. 
The pessimism both of you share in regard to the irredeemable character of Donald Trump is simply a subjective state of mind. It’s an opinion, not a fact. 
I may choose to say, “I can’t stand garlic and onions.” This makes me a garlic-and-onion pessimist. My subjective viewpoint that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables does not make it a scientific fact that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables. The garlic and onion eaters of the world are entitled to tell me to get lost if I told everyone to give up eating garlic and onions. 
So it is with Flopot and Harbinger with their Trump pessimism. They are making a logical mistake in confusing impressions with facts. It is not a FACT that Trump is a scoundrel; at the most it is a subjective opinion. 
HP : Trump is not a politician who has been a politician who grew up a politician and lived and breathed politics all his adult life. Apart from business/social, of course. 
He’s an Alpha businessman who just happens to be waaay more intelligent and personally powerful than 99% of the political mediocres who envy and hate him. 
He came from out of nowhere and like a freight train rolled right over them before they could even cry foul or man an offense against him based on their default slime factor M.O. 
Hell, he vetted them ! Even as the entire weight of the political, M$M, Hollywood, Academia, foreigners, etc., etc., set upon him like no other in memory near or far. But they couldn’t even put a dent in him, or scare him off, and you know the vile demons tried very hard. 
He didn’t scare. But he did and does scare them. A lot. 
Being a uber-quick study, he easily overtook and surpassed the half-bright bureaucrat politicians and within one solitary year he IS The Alpha Politician. 
Putin (and his 12 time zones full of natural resources) will no doubt enjoy Trump. Putin will respect his intelligence, embrace his personality, utilize his uber-business talents and skills, and very very importantly, hugely importantly.. share their big big patriotism for their nations, their citizens.. 
In other words: The world gets an early Christmas present this year! 
UNGENIUS: Well said, HP! I would add only one statement: Trump is not a murderer, but Killery is a murderer of long standing which should make a choice simple between the two. 
GILBERT HUNTLY: Sardonicus, thanks for your healthy and sane perspective! Well said! 🙂 
LOBRO: Seconding that. And add HP’s perceptive comment [ above ] to the score for level headed reason. 
ARIADNATHEO: Sardonicus, Harbinger and Flopot: You are all wrong, as I used to be, I admit. 
“Jewish hegemony,” “zionism” …. are nothing but red herrings that distract our attention from the real enemy. It’s not “Jews, Jews, Jews,” it’s Goyim, goyim, goyim. I owe it to Amy Martin to have finally understood who are, to cite her “the two more powerful lobbyists in the US” — the Podesta brothers! 
Also who are the real rulers whose vast web of corruption brought them virtually absolute power: the Clintons! No Jews are involved anywhere. 
Amy is really good (AND good looking). Why did RT get rid of her? 
KAREN: Ariadnatheo, great satire! 
FLOPOT: Satire reveals truth, though. We’re our own worst enemy — gullible goy; the malleable toy. 
ARIADNATHEO: This is a prediction I trust [ short amusing video ]. 
If you watch, make sure it is BEFORE lunch. 
JOHN KIRBY: Sounds like the usual shakedown.

""My purpose here today is to assert in my judgment, (ISIS) is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including Yazidis, Christians and Shiite Muslims,"" he said, during a news conference at the State Department.

Kerry said that in 2014, ISIS trapped Yazidis, killed them, enslaved thousands of Yazidi women and girls, "" selling them at auction, raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations,"" executed Christians ""solely for their faith"" and also ""forced Christian women and girls into slavery.""

""Without our intervention, it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered,"" he said.

This is the first time that the United States has declared a genocide since Darfur in 2004.

The House of Representatives on Monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the ISIS atrocities against Christian groups in Syria and Iraq ""genocide,"" a term the State Department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group.

The move, aimed at ramping up pressure on the Obama administration, appears to have worked.

The measure was non-binding, but both Republicans and Democrats in the House joined together 393-0 to back a ""sense of Congress"" saying the crimes committed against Christians, Yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and, in some cases, genocide.

Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the U.S., authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo.

During debate on Monday, Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has ""risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives.""

Under a deadline set by Congress, the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation.

Kerry, though, had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS, also know as ISIL, were genocide.

""ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque targeted acts of violence, show all the warning signs of genocide,"" Kerry said in August 2014. ""For anyone who needed a wakeup call, this is it.""

Fortenberry praised the State Department for its decision Thursday.

""I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation. The genocide against Christians, Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities -- it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself,"" he said. ""The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority.""

""That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion, in the face of unspeakable human suffering, defies explanation,"" Rubio, who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement. ""At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil, but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation, if the designation did not then yield some sort of action.""

""I am very happy to hear that (the U.S.) will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities,"" he told CNN in an email. ""This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups, specially ISIS. And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again, because we were left in the hands of Islamic State.""

He called on the State Department to push the U.N. to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria.

""Furthermore,"" he said, ""it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that (these) crimes will not happen again.""

An international center advocating against hate, terrorism and anti-Semitism was one to join the chorus.

""The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerry's acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide,"" the organization said in a statement. ""We reiterate our call that the U.S put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS.""

In Defense of Christians, a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide, put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini.

""IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians, Yazidis, Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide,"" Baaklini said.

And the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, put out a statement of ""appreciation.""

""For some time, the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East. For the U.S. government to call this savagery by its proper name -- genocide -- is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land,"" Wuerl said. ""These words must now be translated into action.""",REAL,cnn secretary of state john kerry said thursday that the united states has determined that isis action against the yazidis and other minority

subway killed  people and wounded more than  isis claims its fighters launched the attacks in the belgian capital my purpose here today is to assert in my judgment isis is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control including yazidis christians and shiite muslims he said during a news conference at the state department kerry said that in  isis trapped yazidis killed them enslaved thousands of yazidi women and girls  selling them at auction raping them at will and destroying the communities in which they had lived for countless generations executed christians solely for their faith and also forced christian women and girls into slavery without our intervention it is clear that those people would have been slaughtered he said this is the first time that the united states has declared a genocide since darfur in  the house of representatives on monday unanimously passed a resolution labeling the isis atrocities against christian groups in syria and iraq genocide a term the state department had been reluctant to use about the attacks and mass murders by the terror group the move aimed at ramping up pressure on the obama administration appears to have worked the measure was nonbinding but both republicans and democrats in the house joined together  to back a sense of congress saying the crimes committed against christians yazidis and other ethnic and religious minorities in the region amount to war crimes and in some cases genocide republican rep jeff fortenberry whose nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled yazidis in the us authored the resolution with california democratic rep anna eshoo during debate on monday fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the house of representatives under a deadline set by congress the state department had until thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation kerry though had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of isis also know as isil were genocide isils campaign of terror against the innocent including the yazidi and christian minorities and its grotesque targeted acts of violence show all the warning signs of genocide kerry said in august  for anyone who needed a wakeup call this is it fortenberry praised the state department for its decision thursday i commend secretary kerry and the state department for making this important designation the genocide against christians yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities  it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself he said the united states has now spoken with clarity and moral authority that it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion in the face of unspeakable human suffering defies explanation rubio who until tuesday was a gop presidential candidate said in a statement at long last the united states is no longer silent in the face of this evil but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation if the designation did not then yield some sort of action i am very happy to hear that the us will recognize the genocide of yezidi and christian minorities he told cnn in an email this is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups specially isis and this is also important for my community to trust the international community again because we were left in the hands of islamic state he called on the state department to push the un to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the yazidis and christians in iraq and syria furthermore he said it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that these crimes will not happen again an international center advocating against hate terrorism and antisemitism was one to join the chorus the simon wiesenthal center applauds secretary kerrys acknowledgement that christians and yazidis are targets of genocide the organization said in a statement we reiterate our call that the us put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy isis in defense of christians a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide put out a statement from its president toufic baaklini idc extends our deepest gratitude to secretary kerry and to the obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against christians yazidis shia muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide baaklini said and the archbishop of washington cardinal donald wuerl put out a statement of appreciation for some time the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by isis to eliminate christians from the middle east for the us government to call this savagery by its proper name  genocide  is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land wuerl said these words must now be translated into action,"['cnn', 'secretary', 'state', 'john', 'kerry', 'said',

4348.0,Mitt Romney's Re-Invention As Anti-Poverty Warrior,"With the shake of an Etch-A-Sketch, Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the Republican Party on Friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality. One only wonders why the former governor of Massachusetts neglected to focus on the growing problems the last time he held the title of GOP standard bearer.

Addressing a gathering of Republican National Committee officials below deck of the decommissioned U.S.S. Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego, California, Romney ticked off three priorities crucial to what he called the ""post-Obama era"": making the world safer with a more muscular foreign policy, providing opportunity to all Americans, and lifting people out of poverty.

""It's a tragedy, a human tragedy, that the middle class in this country by and large doesn't believe that the future will be better than the past,"" he said. ""We haven't seen rising incomes over decades.""

""The rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before under this president,"" he added.

Romney stressed his years as an LDS pastor, a topic he and his campaign rarely broached in 2012, and described working ""with people who are very poor to help them get help.""

The governor isn't the only potential Republican presidential candidate to embrace a more populist tone as wage growth continues to lag in an accelerating economic recovery. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently lamented that ""while the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top-earners, they've been a lost decade for the rest of America."" Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has emphasized reconnecting with blue collar Americans. Even die-hard conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) paid lip service to the matter at the Heritage Foundation policy summit, an annual gathering of conservatives in Washington.

While he may be sincere in his pursuit to eliminate poverty, the notion that Romney would be the best candidate to lead his party in doing so is puzzling at best. The former Massachusetts governor didn't have just one misstep that allowed Democrats and Republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy, out-of-touch plutocrat in the 2012 election -- he had a dozen. Here's just a brief sampling:

""I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it,"" he said inelegantly following his victory in the Florida primary. ""I'm not concerned about the very rich, they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of the America, the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.""

""Corporations are people, my friend ... of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people,"" he said before the Iowa Ames straw poll.

And his infamous remarks about ""47 percent"" of Americans: ""My job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.""

But it's not just the gaffes. Romney embraced the Paul Ryan budget in 2012 -- a sweeping plan that, if enacted, would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor. Millions of low-income Americans benefiting from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as other retirement funding, would have been affected under a Romney presidency. Added to his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies for the poor, it's not hard to see how Romney wouldn't be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president.",REAL,with the shake of an etchasketch mitt romney reintroduced himself to the republican party on friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address

3424.0,King: Fill the Supreme Court vacancy,"""We've got an opening on the court. I think Sandra Day O'Connor made a very practical point. Let's fill the vacancy so the court can fully function and get on with it,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day.""

""I don't agree (with Republicans),"" said O'Connor. ""We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.""

King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he is surprised that some Republicans have decided to reject a nominee before even having a candidate to evaluate.

""I'm surprised people can make that judgment before they even know who the nominee is,"" he said. ""It may be that he picks a nominee that's so eminently qualified that it would be very hard to explain a vote against him, other than politics."" King acknowledged that the Senate doesn't have to support the nominee, but thinks there should be a vote. ""Of course, we have these debates. And of course, politics are involved,"" King said. ""The politics are important. And I'm not saying a Republican senator has to vote for whoever Obama nominates. I would never say that."" But a refusal to hold a process could leave the vacancy for more than a year and that would be ""pretty troublesome,"" King said. The senator, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also expressed concern about a judge's order that Apple help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. ""They're asking Apple to create a key that does not currently exist. And I've got a problem with that. This is a very complicated issue,"" he said. Forcing Apple to do this could set ""a serious precedent"" that could lead to other citizens having their privacy invaded, he said. ""Once that key is made, it can end up in the hands of hackers,"" King said. ""There's no end to complications of this."" ""I think we need to slow down and really consider the policy,"" he added.",REAL,weve got an opening on the court i think sandra day oconnor made a very practical point lets fill the vacancy so the court can fully function and get on with it he told cnns chris cuomo on new day i dont agree with republicans said oconnor we need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it king an independent who caucuses with democrats said he is surprised that some republicans have decided to reject a nominee before even having a candidate to evaluate im surprised people can make that judgment before they even know who the nominee is he said it may be that he picks a nominee thats so eminently qualified that it would be very hard to explain a vote against him other than politics king acknowledged that the senate doesnt have to support the nominee but thinks there should be a vote of course we have these debates and of course politics are involved king said the politics are important and im not saying a republican senator has to vote for whoever obama nominates i would never say that but a refusal to hold a process could leave the vacancy for more than a year and that would be pretty troublesome king said the senator who sits on the senate intelligence committee also expressed concern about a judges order that apple help the fbi break into the iphone of one of the san bernardino california shooters theyre asking apple to create a key that does not currently exist and ive got a problem with that this is a very complicated issue he said forcing apple to do this could set a serious precedent that could lead to other citizens having their privacy invaded he said once that key is made it can end up in the hands of hackers king said theres no end to complications of this i think we need to slow down and really consider the policy he added,"['weve', 'got', 'opening', 'court', 'think', 'sandra', 'day', 'oconnor', 'made', 'practical', 'point', 'lets', 'fill', 'vacancy', 'court', 'fully', 'function', 'get', 'told', 'cnns', 'chris', 'cuomo', 'new', 'day', 'dont', 'agree', 'republicans', 'said', 'oconnor', 'need', 'somebody', 'job', 'get', 'king', 'independent', 'caucuses', 'democrats', 'said', 'surprised', 'republicans', 'decided', 'reject', 'nominee', 'even', 'candidate', 'evaluate', 'im', 'surprised', 'people', 'make', 'judgment', 'even', 'know', 'nominee', 'said', 'may', 'picks', 'nominee', 'thats', 'eminently', 'qualified', 'would', 'hard', 'explain', 'vote', 'politics', 'king', 'acknowledged', 'senate', 'doesnt', 'support', 'nominee', 'thinks', 'vote', 'course', 'debates', 'course', 'politics', 'involved', 'king', 'said', 'politics', 'important', 'im', 'saying', 'republican', 'senator', 'vote', 'whoever', 'obama', 'nominates', 'would', 'never', 'say', 'refusal', 'hold', 'process', 'could', 'leave', 'vacancy', 'year', 'would', 'pretty', 'troublesome', 'king', 'said', 'senator', 'sits', 'senate', 'intelligence', 'committee', 'also', 'expressed', 'concern', 'judges', 'order', 'apple', 'help', 'fbi', 'break', 'iphone', 'one', 'san', 'bernardino', 'california', 'shooters', 'theyre', 'asking', 'apple', 'create', 'key', 'currently', 'exist', 'ive', 'got', 'problem', 'complicated', 'issue', 'said', 'forcing', 'apple', 'could', 'set', 'serious', 'precedent', 'could', 'lead', 'citizens', 'privacy', 'invaded', 'said', 'key', 'made', 'end', 'hands', 'hackers', 'king', 'said', 'theres', 'end', 'complications', 'think', 'need', 'slow', 'really', 'consider', 'policy', 'added']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'CARDINAL', 'GPE']","{'NORP': 4, 'ORG': 3, 'PERSON': 2, 'DATE': 2, 'CARDINAL': 1, 'GPE': 1}",3,2,1,331,-0.009562732589048387,91
1718.0,"Ted Cruz is toast: It’s not just that he won’t be president — his days in the Senate are numbered, too","I’m not sure when it started, but at some point the Republican Party ceded the business of governance to the Democrats. Maybe it began with the Tea Party movement or Fox News or the larger conservative media-industrial complex – I honestly don’t know. But it’s clear now that the GOP is no longer a legitimate governing party. A party that allows rank neophytes like Herman Cain and Donald Trump and Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina to run for the highest office in the country has lost its way.

If you look at how the Republican Party operates today, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that governing just isn’t a priority – or internal pressures within the party make it impossible. Instead, the GOP has become what I previously called a self-perpetuating hype machine for conservative political entrepreneurs. Particularly at the national level, Republican candidates and legislators (many of them, at least) show no interest in compromise or serious policymaking, which is what you’d expect from a party of and for purists.

While the new GOP has been bad for the country, it’s been great for political celebrities, people looking to promote their personal brands. Ted Cruz is the most recent and obvious example of this approach to politics. Cruz has been a remarkably ineffective Senator. He has done nothing but bloviate and showboat on the Senate floor. He’s accomplished zero legislatively. His only practical contribution has been to obstruct and draw attention to his martyrdom (read: presidential) campaign.

Ted Cruz will never be elected president. If he manages to win the Republican nomination, he’ll lose in a landslide to a Democrat, whoever that happens to be. And because he’s so eagerly made a spectacle of himself in the Senate, he’s alienated all but the tiniest segment of his own party. Which means he has no political capital in Congress – hardly a concern for someone uninterested in legislating, however.

Cruz’s latest squabble with Rand Paul helps to illustrate Cruz’s intentions. In an interview with Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Paul basically wrote Cruz’s political obituary:

Ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate, and as a consequence he can’t get anything done legislatively. He is pretty much done for and stifled and it’s really because of personal relationships, or lack of personal relationships, and it is a problem. I approach things a little different, I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing , I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and it’s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result.

Paul is right, of course, but he omits an essential point: Cruz has been ineffective by design. Managing relationships and respecting decorum only matter to people trying to accomplish things in the Senate – that’s not what Cruz is up to. Like the fanatical Tea Party wing of the House, Cruz is there to obstruct and self-promote. In all likelihood, Cruz will retire after a single term in the Senate. Now that he’s boosted his national profile and endeared himself to the insurgent elements of the base, he can pivot to the private sector and make more money as a professional conservative activist – as, for example, Jim DeMint did in 2012. Cruz ought to be seen as the grifter that he is. It was never about policy for him. When he leaves the Senate, he’ll be a hero to the fringe right. He’ll make a fortune on the conservative lecture circuit, telling rapturous audiences about his willingness to challenge the “Washington cartel.” It won’t matter that he accomplished nothing, changed nothing – it’ll be enough that he pretended to while he was there. The same is true of Carson and Trump and Fiorina and even politicians like Huckabee and Jindal: None of them will be president, but their over-the-top activism will ensure them a profitable career after politics. And that, I assume, is the whole point. The Democrats have their share of bad politicians, but you don’t see this kind of faux activism and exploitation in their party.",REAL,im not sure when it started but at some point the republican

143.0,Obama’s speech in Selma was an answer to those who question his love for America,"President Obama's supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of 2008 has gone. The answer is to the White House. Obama's presidency is about smaller, less inspiring questions than his 2008 campaign.

Obama's presidency is bounded by the limits of the office and the demands of the moment. It is about what America needs to do right now — the next budget, the next bill, next year's taxes, the last war. Candidates can muse. Presidents must govern.

Obama's 2008 campaign was about what kind of country America is; how to read its past to best guide its future. His speech in Selma — which is really worth reading in its entirety — was among the best of his presidency precisely because it had almost nothing to do with his presidency; it was a return to the central topic of his campaign.

Historians who want to understand Obama will find few better summations than the two paragraphs at the core of this speech:

We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to America. If you think nothing's changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or L.A. of the Fifties. Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing's changed. Ask your gay friend if it's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago. To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America better. Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that racism is banished, that the work that drew men and women to Selma is complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the ""race card"" for their own purposes. We don't need the Ferguson report to know that's not true. We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us. We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.

Those 230 words are a precise distillation of Obama's view of America, and the role politics must play in it.

The first paragraph is Obama's case for hope: America is improving; it has always been improving, and to deny that improvement is to steal from Americans a belief in their country that they have more than earned. ""To deny this progress — our progress — would be to rob us of our own agency,"" he said.

The second paragraph is Obama's case for change: America's sins are not vanquished; its hatreds remain real; its racism still breathes. ""We know the march is not yet over,"" Obama said, ""the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.""

Hope and change. These are the two ideas that form the steady core of Obama's politics. But, more than that, they are the two ideas that define, for Obama, what kind of country America is — and what it means to serve it.

Obama's critics question his love for the country he governs. ""I do not believe — and I know this is a horrible thing to say — but I do not believe that the president loves America,"" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February. They look at Obama's steady belief that America is not yet good enough, not yet pure enough, not yet perfect enough, and they see a skeptic, not a patriot.

In this speech, Obama's answer to this criticism was direct:

Fellow marchers, so much has changed in fifty years. We've endured war, and fashioned peace. We've seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives, and take for granted convenience our parents might scarcely imagine. But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship, that willingness of a 26 year-old deacon, or a Unitarian minister, or a young mother of five, to decide they loved this country so much that they'd risk everything to realize its promise. That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America. That's what it means when we say America is exceptional.

There is an implicit radicalism in what Obama is saying here. To believe America is good enough is to abandon the tradition of criticism and activism that has made America great.

Obama's answer to Giuliani is that Giuliani has mistaken uncritical adoration for the hard work required of true love. Patriotism is active, not passive. Those who love America prove it by working to perfect America. They continue marching.",REAL,president obamas supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of  has gone the answer is to the white house obamas presidency is about smaller less

930.0,Where Does Bernie Sanders Go From Here?,"NEW YORK - Bernie Sanders is at a crossroads.

The Vermont senator took Wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife, leaving his top aides behind in Washington to cool their heels.

""He wanted an opportunity to think,"" said Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine. ""It's affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign, what he wants to say in the weeks ahead. He hasn't had a real chance to do that"" in weeks.

The Sanders campaign poured itself into New York, throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could. They spent $5.6 million (twice what Hillary Clinton did), made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone, and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big rallies.

But in the end Sanders came up short - not just of winning, but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit, which might set them up for a path through California, the campaign's final hope.

Now, with the nomination even further out of reach, Sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next. Does he set a do-whatever-it-takes course to actually win the Democratic nomination? Or does he return to the message campaign his long-shot White House bid was originally seen as?

There's no question that Sanders will stay in the race either way. ""Bernie made a decision after Nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote, vote,"" Devine said.

Democratic primary voters have shown no sign they're in a rush for the race to settle down, and seem hungry for Sanders' message, if not his presidency.

He'll continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans, who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish. On Wednesday night, the campaign announced raising $15 million more than Clinton in March, though they also spent much more.

But even some Sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidate's message in New York, where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on Clinton and issues with the election process.

""Going forward, what we're encouraging Senator Sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues,"" said Neil Sroka, the communications director of Democracy for America, which backs Sanders.

The campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues - but only as long as the Clinton campaign joins them. So far, at least, they believe Clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign Clinton still views Sanders as a threat.

Privately, some Sanders allies say it's time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the Democratic National Convention, and afterwards, and less about beating Clinton at all costs.

One indicator of which kind of campaign Sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nomination.

The strategy, which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if Sanders loses more primaries and caucuses, was floated by campaign manager Jeff Weaver with MSNBC's Steve Kornacki late Tuesday night.

MoveOn.org and Democracy for America, both of which have endorsed Sanders, have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votes.

More than 380,000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that ""the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes, and not who has the most support from party insiders.""

Both groups confirmed to MSNBC Wednesday that they still hold that position.

""MoveOn members overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders for president, and we want him to win the most pledged delegates, become the nominee, and become president. But superdelegates shouldn't overrule the will of the Democratic grassroots,"" said MoveOn Washington Director Ben Wikler. ""If the primary and caucus winner is Hillary Clinton, then Clinton should be the nominee.""

Devine said the campaign's main focus is still to win pledged delegates. But if Sanders falls just short of a majority, it's negligible - ""de minims,"" Devine said - and the campaign will pitch super delegates that Sanders is the stronger general election candidate.

Another indication of Sanders' intentions will be where he devotes his precious time in the days leading up to Tuesday's contests.

Five states are voting and Maryland is expected to be Sanders' worst showing.

If he invests heavily there it's a sign his campaign is still focused on winning and scraping together delegates. If he spends time in states like Connecticut and Delaware to try to eek out wins despite limited delegate opportunities, it's a sign he's more focused on moral victories than ones that lead to the nomination.

What Sanders decides to do, and how aggressively he decides to continuing pursuing Clinton, will help determine the shape of the rest of the primary and how quickly Clinton, the odds-on nominee, can unite the party.

Clinton's favorability rating has tumbled during the primary, especially among Sanders voters, presumably at least in part due to his attacks.

But as Democratic leaders worry about the damage, the party seem to be enjoying the contest.

National polling between Clinton and Sanders has tightened to a virtual dead heat, suggesting voters are not ready to settle on Clinton. Exit polls showed two-thirds of New York primary voters found the heated contest in the state to be energizing, not divisive.

""Mr. Sanders's presence has made this an immeasurably more substantive race,"" The New York Times wrote in an editorial Wednesday calling on Sanders to ignore calls to leave the race, which was shared by the Sanders campaign. The enthusiasm of his supporters ""should be a wake-up call to leaders of both parties. They are missing something big about their own members' priorities, and their mood.""

Still, Sanders' entire campaign has been about bringing new people into politics and the Democratic party. At some point, he might risk pushing them back out again.",REAL,new york  bernie sanders is at a crossroads the vermont senator took wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife

For centuries, the Catholic Church had locked up the Bible and kept it out of reach of the common man. As a result, when the Protestant Reformation ended the Dark Ages and removed the Bible from its Vatican shackles, it was a book that remained quite a mystery to most people. Out of all of its 66 books, the most misunderstood, most debated over and most feared book is, ironically and undoubtedly, the book of Revelation. 
On this episode of Rightly Dividing , we apply Paul’s command to “rightly divide” to the book of Revelation, and in the process of doing so remove much of the mystery in the process. God didn’t write any part of the Bible to be out of reach of anyone who, by faith, wanted to plumb its depths and unlock its mysteries.

10232.0,Silent Counter-Coup by 17 Intel Agencies To Stop Crooked Clintons [Video],"Leave a reply 
Bill Still – Good evening, I’m still reporting on an ongoing counter-coup being run by patriotic members of 17 U.S. intelligence agencies to stop the Clinton Crime syndicate from proceeding with the rigging of the coming election. 
According to a 4 minute video, done by Dr. Steve Pieczenik, a Harvard and MIT-educated psychiatrist who has written 26 New York Times Best Sellers, the Clinton coup has been put down by an intelligence community counter-coup, effective at noon today. 
Dr. Pieczenik has great contacts in the American intelligence community. He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. 
Currently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. 
I believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations. To me, hackers could not have done this. To me, white hats at NSA had to have been involved. 
Having spent my adult life working around the community, I knew that folks who were at most of these agencies – exempting DHS and CIA – are American patriots who would not allow this nation to be destroyed by the Clinton Crime Syndicate.

This may well be the reason President Obama yesterday had his press secretary praise the work of Jim Comey, head of the FBI, at the very moment that Hillary Clinton was speaking in Florida deriding Comey. Let us all pray that Comey has actually turned away from being subservient to Obama and the Clintons and has now joined forces with the vast majority of the American military/intelligence community and Obama has decided – for his own preservation – to not fight them.

1360.0,"Why Hillary Clinton, not Bernie Sanders, 'won' town hall","Hillary Clinton accepts the Democratic Party's nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28. The former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state was the first woman to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party.

Clinton waves to the media in January 1996 as she arrives for an appearance before a grand jury in Washington. The first lady was subpoenaed to testify as a witness in the investigation of the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas. The Clintons' business investment was investigated, but ultimately they were cleared of any wrongdoing.

Clinton looks on as her husband discusses the Monica Lewinsky scandal in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 26, 1998. Clinton declared, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman."" In August of that year, Clinton testified before a grand jury and admitted to having ""inappropriate intimate contact"" with Lewinsky, but he said it did not constitute sexual relations because they had not had intercourse. He was impeached in December on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.

Obama and Clinton talk on the plane on their way to a rally in Unity, New Hampshire, in June 2008. She had recently ended her presidential campaign and endorsed Obama.

In this photo provided by the White House, Obama, Clinton, Biden and other members of the national security team receive an update on the mission against Osama bin Laden in May 2011.

Clinton checks her Blackberry inside a military plane after leaving Malta in October 2011. In 2015, The New York Times reported that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her time as secretary of state. The account, fed through its own server, raises security and preservation concerns. Clinton later said she used a private domain out of ""convenience,"" but admits in retrospect ""it would have been better"" to use multiple emails.

Clinton testifies about the Benghazi attack during a House committee meeting in October 2015. ""I would imagine I have thought more about what happened than all of you put together,"" she said during the 11-hour hearing. ""I have lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been wracking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done."" Months earlier, Clinton had acknowledged a ""systemic breakdown"" as cited by an Accountability Review Board, and she said that her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders shares a lighthearted moment with Clinton during a Democratic presidential debate in October 2015. It came after Sanders gave his take on the Clinton email scandal. ""The American people are sick and tired of hearing about the damn emails,"" Sanders said. ""Enough of the emails. Let's talk about the real issues facing the United States of America.""

After Clinton became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, this photo was posted to her official Twitter account. ""To every little girl who dreams big: Yes, you can be anything you want -- even president,"" Clinton said. ""Tonight is for you.""

Obama hugs Clinton after he gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. The president said Clinton was ready to be commander in chief. ""For four years, I had a front-row seat to her intelligence, her judgment and her discipline,"" he said, referring to her stint as his secretary of state.",REAL,hillary clinton accepts the democratic

3635.0,French police hunt two brothers accused of Charlie Hebdo terror attack,"A third suspect has turned himself in. Prime Minister Valls said several arrests had been made overnight in connection with the deadliest terror attack in France in a generation.

French President Francois Hollande, right, and interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve, left, listen to the explanations of high ranking police officer Jacques Meric, center, during a visit at Paris Prefecture control room in Paris, Thursday Jan. 8, 2015. French police hunted Thursday for two heavily armed men, one with a terrorism conviction and a history in jihadi networks, in the methodical killing of 12 people at a satirical newspaper that caricatured the Prophet Muhammad. The prime minister announced several overnight arrests and said the possibility of a new attack “is our main concern.”

French authorities are searching for two chief suspects in Wednesday's deadly attack in Paris on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine, which left 12 people dead in France's deadliest terrorist incident in a generation.

Thousands of police and counter-terrorism officers are searching in northern France for the two armed suspects, Said and Chérif Kouachi, who are brothers, remain at large. A third suspect, Hamyd Mourad, turned himself in at a police station in a small town about 145 miles northeast of Paris after learning his name was linked to the attack.

Speaking on RTL radio, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said authorities had made several overnight arrests and that the possibility of a new attack by the two suspects “is our main concern,” The New York Times reports. An unnamed security official put the arrest total at seven.

“We are facing an unprecedented terrorist threat, both internally and externally,” Mr. Valls said, adding that, “there was not zero risk.”

In an incident likely to rattle nerves in Paris, a policewoman was killed in a shootout in southern Paris on Thursday morning. The shooting set off searches in the area as the manhunt for the two brothers expanded, but police didn't immediately link it to the Charlie Hebdo attack, Reuters reports. The policewoman wasn't involved in the manhunt for the suspects and had been called to a routine traffic incident.

Valls said the suspects in the attack on Charlie Hebdo were known to French authorities and had been tracked before. Chérif Kouachi was convicted of abetting terrorism in 2008 for recruiting jihadists to fight in Iraq, the Associated Press reports. Both brothers were also named in connection with a plot to help an Islamic extremist, who bombed a Paris metro station in 1995, escape from jail.

The brothers are Algerian-origin French citizens who lived in Paris, the BBC reports.

Given his track record, the fact that Chérif Kouachi allegedly pulled off such a brazen attack may raise concerns in France and across Europe. It's still unclear whether the brothers had any foreign support or trained abroad. European security agencies fear that militants from Europe who fight in Iraq and Syria could in future stage attacks at home.

The Christian Science Monitor reports that France has Europe’s largest Muslim population and the largest number of citizens who have joined groups such as the self-described Islamic State. Some 1,000 French have traveled to fight in Syria, according to authorities.

Charlie Hebdo, which directs its irrelevant satire at almost everyone, has repeatedly offended Muslims for its caricatures of the prophet Muhammad.

3255.0,Give Social Security recipients a CEO-style raise,"(CNN) On Veterans Day we recognize and honor the sacrifices our service members and their families make for our country. We owe our service members the very best, but unless Congress acts, on January 1 more than 9 million veterans who rely on Social Security benefits or pension and compensation benefits will not get their annual cost of living increase.

This freeze in funds, which has happened only two other times since 1975, will be really tough on veterans among the 71 million Americans who depend on Social Security and other benefits to help make ends meet. Two-thirds of seniors depend on Social Security for the majority of their income, and for 15 million Americans, Social Security is all that stands between them and poverty.

While vets and seniors get no raise, CEOs at the top 350 American companies received, on average, a 3.9% pay increase last year. That's a lot of money. The average CEO at one of the top 350 American companies made $16.3 million and got more than half a million in pay raises. So CEOs get huge raises, while seniors, veterans and others who've worked hard don't get an extra dime. Why? It's not an accident. It's not inevitable. It's the result of deliberate policies set by Congress.

Social Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when prices go up, benefits go up, too. But Congress' formula samples the spending patterns of about a quarter of the country, and the formula isn't geared to what older Americans actually spend.

Projections for the costs of core goods and services show inflation is up about 2%, but seniors won't get a cost of living increase -- mostly because of falling gasoline prices, which don't mean as much to millions of seniors who don't commute to work. So seniors, who are already struggling to scrape by to cover rent and exploding prescription drug prices , will be left scrambling.

Sure, companies should make their own decisions about how much to compensate executives, but because of the laws Congress has passed, American taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimillion-dollar pay packages.

It's time for Congress to make different choices. That's why last week I introduced the Seniors And Veterans Emergency (SAVE) Benefits Act. The SAVE Benefits Act will give seniors on Social Security, veterans, those with disabilities and others a one-time payment in 2016 equivalent to an average increase of 3.9% -- the same as the taxpayer-subsidized raise that CEOs received last year.

We can afford to give seniors and vets a raise. In fact, we can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single penny to the deficit simply by closing the bonus loophole for corporate executives. According to the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, closing this loophole will create enough revenue to help millions of Americans and still have enough left over to help extend the life of the Social Security trust fund.

Seniors and vets would get an increase of about $581 next year — a little less than $50 a month. That $581 increase would cover almost three months of groceries for seniors or a year's worth of out-of-pocket costs on critical prescription drugs for the average Medicare beneficiary. That $50 a month is worth a lot to those 71 million Americans. According to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, that little boost could lift more than 1 million Americans out of poverty.

Giving vets and seniors a little help and stitching up these corporate tax write-offs isn't just about economics; it's about our values. For too long, we've listened to a handful of people with money and power who say: Cut taxes for those at the top, cut rules and regulations that keep everyone honest, and let everyone else fight over the scraps. We tried trickle-down economics, and it failed.

But we can make different choices -- choices that reflect our values. We don't have to ignore this problem. We can give a small boost to 71 million Americans who have earned it and who need it.

We can lift over 1 million people out of poverty. We can extend the life of Social Security. And we can do it by shutting down taxpayer giveaways to a handful of wealthy corporations that will do fine without them. For me, this is simple. Our spending should reflect our values, and that means passing the SAVE Benefits Act.",REAL,cnn on veterans day we recognize and honor the sacrifices our service members and their families make for

spending patterns of about a quarter of the country and the formula isnt geared to what older americans actually spend projections for the costs of core goods and services show inflation is up about  but seniors wont get a cost of living increase  mostly because of falling gasoline prices which dont mean as much to millions of seniors who dont commute to work so seniors who are already struggling to scrape by to cover rent and exploding prescription drug prices  will be left scrambling sure companies should make their own decisions about how much to compensate executives but because of the laws congress has passed american taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimilliondollar pay packages its time for congress to make different choices thats why last week i introduced the seniors and veterans emergency save benefits act the save benefits act will give seniors on social security veterans those with disabilities and others a onetime payment in  equivalent to an average increase of   the same as the taxpayersubsidized raise that ceos received last year we can afford to give seniors and vets a raise in fact we can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single penny to the deficit simply by closing the bonus loophole for corporate executives according to the chief actuary of the social security administration closing this loophole will create enough revenue to help millions of americans and still have enough left over to help extend the life of the social security trust fund seniors and vets would get an increase of about  next year  a little less than  a month that  increase would cover almost three months of groceries for seniors or a years worth of outofpocket costs on critical prescription drugs for the average medicare beneficiary that  a month is worth a lot to those  million americans according to an analysis from the economic policy institute that little boost could lift more than  million americans out of poverty giving vets and seniors a little help and stitching up these corporate tax writeoffs isnt just about economics its about our values for too long weve listened to a handful of people with money and power who say cut taxes for those at the top cut rules and regulations that keep everyone honest and let everyone else fight over the scraps we tried trickledown economics and it failed but we can make different choices  choices that reflect our values we dont have to ignore this problem we can give a small boost to  million americans who have earned it and who need it we can lift over  million people out of poverty we can extend the life of social security and we can do it by shutting down taxpayer giveaways to a handful of wealthy corporations that will do fine without them for me this is simple our spending should reflect our values and that means passing the save benefits act,"['cnn', 'veterans', 'day', 'recognize', 'honor', 'sacrifices', 'service', 'members', 'families', 'make', 'country', 'owe', 'service',

3177.0,"Fireworks erupt between Trump and Bush, Rubio and Cruz at GOP debate","Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night, as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W. Bush’s legacy, trading insults at a rapid clip – and the two Cuban-American senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each other’s Spanish-speaking skills.

And just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other, the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessman’s pro-life credentials.

“You are the single biggest liar. You’re probably worse than Jeb Bush,” Trump said.

Cruz stood his ground, charging that Trump would “appoint liberals” to the Supreme Court if elected.

The issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS News-hosted debate in Greenville, S.C., in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election. Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmation.

But the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race, as the candidates charge into next week’s critical South Carolina primary. The clashes left Ohio Gov. John Kasich – the affable, second-place finisher in the New Hampshire primary – making an appeal for peace in the GOP field, albeit one unlikely to be heeded.

“I think we’re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don’t stop this,” Kasich said.

Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, too, warned about the coming general election and said, “We cannot be tearing each other down.”

The appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration. It’s an argument they’ve had before – Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status, and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort – but this time, it became more heated. And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldn’t rescind President Obama’s immigration executive orders on day one, Rubio quipped:

“I don’t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn’t speak Spanish,” Rubio said.

Cruz, then, immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish. Rubio continued, saying Cruz “lies about all sorts of things” and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrants.

As the Rubio-Cruz battle heated up, so did the long-simmering feud between Trump and Bush.

“This is a man who insults his way to the nomination,” Bush said of Trump.

With Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before – boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audience.

The audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush, though Trump once again accused them of representing Bush’s “special interests and lobbyists.”

Their most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the U.S. mired more deeply in the Middle East – and blamed the former Florida governor’s brother for the problems there.

Trump initially took issue with Jeb Bush’s call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syria’s Bashar Assad and sidelining Russia.

“Jeb is so wrong,” Trump said. “You have to knock out ISIS. .... You decide what you have to do after. You can’t fight two wars at one time.”

Bush, though, said Russia is not a U.S. ally, and Assad’s hold on power prevents a resolution in the war. Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W. Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place, calling it a “big fat mistake” that “destabilized the Middle East.”

“They lied” about WMDs, he said.

“I am sick and tired of him going after my family,” Jeb Bush countered, saying he’s proud of his brother’s efforts to keep the country safe.

Trump then invoked 9/11: “The World Trade Center came down … That’s not keeping us safe.”

Rubio, who has often been at odds with Bush, leapt to his brother’s defense, saying the Bush administration “kept us safe.”

Jeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trump’s invitation to an upcoming rally with George W. Bush on the campaign trail.

The fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note, discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will have.

Several candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy, and wait for the next president to make that decision. Trump, though, said he doesn’t expect Obama to wait, and called on Senate Republicans to hold up any nomination.

Kasich urged Obama to put the “country first” and not move forward with a nomination, a plea echoed by Rubio. Obama, though, said minutes before the start of the debate that he indeed plans to nominate a successor.

The GOP candidates, meanwhile, used opening remarks to honor Scalia’s legacy.

Cruz called him a “legal giant” who “changed the arc of American legal history.” He said Scalia’s death also “underscores the stakes of this election.”

“We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion” by states, threaten gun rights and “undermine” religious liberty, Cruz said. He said he would appoint a strict constitutionalist if elected.

Scalia’s death thrusts the issue of judicial appointments into the 2016 race, raising the possibility that the next president immediately will have to fill a high court vacancy. While Obama vowed Saturday to nominate a successor, it’s unclear whether he can get any appointee confirmed in the Republican-led Senate.

While the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy now looms over the race, the South Carolina primary already was heating up on several fronts in recent days, with the candidates trading accusations on immigration and other issues.

The debate Saturday reflects that tougher tone, in a state notorious for bare-knuckle primary battles. Trump at one point accused Cruz of trying to spread rumors in the state that he’s not running in South Carolina – likening that to his campaign’s actions in Iowa, where representatives spread false rumors that Carson was dropping out.

“Nasty guy, now I know why he doesn’t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues,” Trump said.

Even Kasich struggled to avoid the fray, as Bush criticized him for expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and said that would create more debt.

“He knows that I’m not for ObamaCare,” Kasich said, before vowing to stay “positive. “

The GOP field is now down to six candidates -- after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina dropped out following low finishes Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary.

A big question Saturday night, and going forward, was whether Rubio could regain his momentum – following last weekend’s lackluster performance. A withering attack by Christie on Rubio, which had the Florida senator repeating himself, appeared to hurt him in the New Hampshire primary. Rubio himself blamed his debate performance in part for his fifth-place finish in the state. He finished behind Trump, Kasich, Cruz and Bush. Christie, though, is no longer on stage or in the race.

Most polling in South Carolina still shows Rubio third, with Trump and Cruz in the top two positions, respectively.",REAL,sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest gop primary debate yet saturday

4294.0,How Ted Cruz Became Ted Cruz,"In 2008, in the high-profile Supreme Court gun-rights case called District of Columbia v. Heller, a brief was filed from the eighth floor of the Price Daniel Sr. State Office Building in Austin, Texas, specifically from the corner office of the man who was then the state’s solicitor general, Ted Cruz.

The brief took a strong stance on the divisive question of whether the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to own guns, or just protects state and local militias. The brief argued forcefully for the first view, writing that “the individual right to keep and bear arms” is a “fundamental right” and that “an individual right that can be altogether abrogated is no right at all.” Thirty attorneys general from other states signed on.

Today, with the White House pushing new gun restrictions and Cruz's candidacy riding on next month's Iowa caucuses, it's no surprise that the Texas Republican would embrace gun rights as a defining issue, holding an event at a firing range and even raffling off an engraved 12-gauge shotgun as a campaign promotion.

In 2008, the situation was very different: he was wading into a case that had no immediate connection to Texas at all. But to see the signature of R. Ted Cruz on the brief would not have surprised the nine Supreme Court justices in the least. By that time, Cruz had been solicitor general for five years, and inserting himself into a case of wide prominence and importance regardless of any direct tie to Texas had become part of his playbook. He clearly saw the Heller case as a watershed in gun rights, writing that it would “determine whether the Second Amendment has any modern relevance.” And he was right. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision shot down the Washington, D.C., handgun ban and ruled for the first time in the history of this country that the amendment ensures an individual person’s right to have a gun for self-defense. The National Rifle Association recognized Cruz’s role with a resolution.

As Cruz climbs to the top of the Republican presidential field, the five-plus years he served as the solicitor general of Texas remain the most important period in his public résumé. They’re the record he ran on when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012—and they represent significantly more of his working life than the three years he has served so far in the Senate. They're also a prime source of fodder for liberal and moderate critics, should be become the Republican presidential nominee.

A Politico review of Cruz’s record as solicitor general shows he used the role in a new and far more ideological way than his predecessors, taking a relatively low-profile job that had traditionally been used mostly to defend the state government and turning it into a stage for pushing national conservative causes. Cruz argued eight cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court—far more than his predecessors and successors—using each of them to advance a position endorsed by conservative thinkers. He also was the counsel of record on some 70 friend-of-the-court briefs, or amicus briefs, weighing in on cases across the country, like Heller, in which Texas had no direct stake, but which similarly offered a chance to argue ideological points.

“He really turned the office into a platform,” David Bernstein, a George Mason law professor who recently wrote a book about the Obama administration for which Cruz wrote the foreword, said in an interview.

“He built up the national aura of the office,” said Tom Phillips, who was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Texas at the start of Cruz’s run as solicitor general.

Cruz’s zealous work served the ambitions of the conservative movement, but he also personally used it to build a bridge between what he was (an elite constitutional law nerd) to what he is today (an ascendant right-wing politician). Yet while pleasing to conservatives, other aspects of his record are sure to attract critics. He argued against leniency for an unjustly sentenced man whose lawyer had made a technical mistake; he invoked 13th-century “Saxon law” and the practice of cutting off testicles to justify harsher punishments in a rape case; and he referred to a late-term abortion technique as “infanticide.”

Although little examined in the race so far, Cruz’s time as solicitor general built him a powerful allegiance among the conservative donors necessary to launch a national campaign. Heading into Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond, he has more money at his disposal than any candidate besides Jeb Bush. And the way he used that Texas office is part of the reason. Toby Neugebauer, who wrote a $10 million check to the Cruz super PAC called Keep the Promise II, told me the reason he did that—the single reason—is what Cruz did as solicitor general. He said other major donors feel the same way.

“We’re backing someone,” Neugebauer told me, “that had a worldview and went out and executed on it.”

Cruz took the solicitor job as a reboot of sorts after his initial foray into politics had fizzled.

As a debater at Princeton, as a law school student at Harvard, and as a clerk to then-Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Cruz was widely considered brilliant—but he left his first real job as a promising appellate attorney in private practice in Washington to instead toil in 2000 as a domestic policy analyst in George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, then as a legal hand for Bush’s team in the frantic recount in Florida that ultimately won Bush the election.

In return, Cruz “desperately” wanted “a senior post” in the White House, he wrote in his autobiography. On the campaign, though, he had earned a reputation for his outsized ego as much as for his obvious intelligence, and the post-election jobs he got were out-of-the-way roles at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. “I just don’t like the guy,” Bush has said since. The solicitor general role in his home state of Texas, offered to him by Greg Abbott—then the attorney general of Texas, now the governor—was a political lifeline.

From the start, it offered a chance to turn his legal acumen into political potential, because it came with a green light to advance conservative aims in the courts. Abbott’s directive for the solicitor general of Texas, Cruz said in his book, was to “look across the country” and “identify chances to defend conservative principles.”

This is not the traditional definition of a solicitor general’s job, which comes with two main duties. The first: States get sued, attorneys general and their staffs respond, and some of the cases get appealed—and that’s where the solicitor general comes in, representing the state in higher courts, where the cases are the most legalistic and complex. The second: the writing of amicus briefs in cases elsewhere in which a state believes it has an interest even though it’s not a party.

The first part can be seen as defense. The second part is more like offense, selectively advancing the interests of the state. The way Cruz did the job? Even the defense was offense, and the interests being asserted were less those of the state than its conservative leaders.

“Texas is a huge state, and there’s plenty of work for the attorney general’s office to do,” said Jim Ho, an attorney in Dallas who succeeded Cruz as solicitor general and is a friend and supporter. Cruz, though, “was not content to simply do what was asked and go home.”

When it came to cases that allowed him to argue for things like the forceful application of the death penalty and expressions of religion in the public arena and against things like abortion and gun control, Ho told me, Cruz “was on constant watch for opportunities to press a conservative vision of the Constitution.”",REAL,in  in the highprofile supreme court gunrights case called district of

1524.0,Accord reached after Sanders sues the DNC over suspended access to critical voter list,"The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee on Friday, arguing that the party had unfairly suspended the campaign’s access to key voter information. After several tense hours, both sides announced a deal had been reached.

The suit came shortly after campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged at a Washington news conference that Sanders staffers had improperly reviewed information gathered by rival Hillary Clinton earlier in the week. But he accused the DNC of over­reacting to the breach by suspending the Sanders campaign’s ability to access the computer system containing information about Democratic-leaning voters, including data the campaign has gathered about its own supporters.

After midnight, Sanders and the DNC put out statements that both indicated the impasse had been resolved but that put remarkably different spins on the outcome. Sanders’s campaign said the DNC had “capitulated” and that Sanders would soon regain access to the data. The DNC said what happened was “completely unacceptable” and that it would continue to investigate the circumstances even as Sanders regained access to the valuable information.

Without a quick resolution, the messy public brawl threatened to overshadow Saturday’s third Democratic presidential debate and cast doubt on the DNC’s ability to manage the sophisticated data tools necessary for the party to win the White House next year. And it sparked significant suspicions among Sanders supporters that the party was conspiring to give a boost to Clinton.

DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz rejected that allegation Friday, alleging that Sanders staffers had exploited a software error to essentially “steal” data from Clinton’s campaign. Wasserman Schultz said the party would not allow Sanders access to the critical database again until his campaign agreed to an independent audit of what happened.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, argued that under a contract between the DNC and the campaign governing the data system’s use, formal notice in writing is required if either side believes the other has violated the deal. In addition, each side is supposed to be allowed 10 days to address any concerns, the suit said.

“The DNC may not suspend the Campaign’s access to critical Voter Data out of haste or desperation to clean up after the DNC’s own mistakes,” the suit says.

The voter data is heavily used to raise money, and the Sanders campaign estimated that it is losing $600,000 a day in “critical fundraising and publicity opportunities” without access to the files.

The incident strained the relationship between the campaign of an upstart Vermont senator who until this year has run as an independent and a national party his supporters have long accused of favoring Clinton.

Weaver accused the party of purposely sabotaging Sanders by refusing to restore access to the voter information.

“By their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign,” Weaver said. “I think if you look at the pattern of conduct . . . it looks like in this case they’re trying to help the Clinton campaign.”

NGP-VAN, the computer vendor that provides Democrats with detailed information about voters, has said that a computer error on Wednesday briefly allowed the campaigns to review information that had been gathered by their rivals.

The company maintains a master voter list for the DNC and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by rival campaigns.

The Sanders campaign has acknowledged that several of its staffers probed the system during the time of the error cited by NGP-VAN. One operative, data director Josh Uretsky, was fired as a result of the incident. Weaver said the actions of several others are being reviewed.

Landing at the airport in Manchester, N.H., ahead of Saturday’s debate, Wasserman Schultz said that Sanders himself was unaware of the breach until she called to discuss it 24 hours after it took place. “He was stunned,” she said. “I know that Sen. Sanders had absolutely nothing to do with this. . . . Unfortunately, he has staff who acted inappropriately, and they need to be held accountable.”

The severity of the data breach itself remained an issue of serious dispute Friday.

Audit data from NGP-VAN and provided to The Washington Post by the Clinton campaign showed that four Sanders staffers conducted 24 separate searches of Clinton data during a 40-minute window Wednesday, targeting early voting states and searching for lists of voters most and least likely to support Clinton. The logs show that in some cases, the staffers saved the search results in new folders created within the system.

“This was a very egregious breach and our data was stolen. This was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data,” Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, told reporters.

On CNN, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon accused the Sanders staffers of acting “like kids in the candy store.”

“They went hog wild, downloading as much data as they could,” he said.

Later Friday, the Clinton camp struck a more conciliatory tone, issuing a statement in which Fallon said that his campaign was hopeful the matter would be resolved Friday night and that the Sanders team would get access to its voter files “right away.”

Uretsky told The Post that he and the others conducted the searches of Clinton data after they discovered the software glitch only in an effort to discover the extent of their own data exposure. “We intentionally did it in a way that was trackable and traceable so that when they did an audit they would be able to see exactly what we did,” he said.

Uretsky said there was no attempt to take Clinton information out of the software system.

Weaver blamed the software vendor for the breach, which allowed all campaigns to access one another’s data for a time, insisting that the Sanders campaign had actually quietly alerted the DNC to problems with another vendor system in October.

In the lawsuit, the campaign argued that a “similar security incident” during the 2008 presidential campaign resulted in “unintentional transmission of confidential information” to Clinton’s unsuccessful presidential campaign against Barack Obama.

Weaver said a tick-tock provided to the Sanders campaign by the computer vendor confirmed that staffers were not attempting to remove significant Clinton data from the system.

“We are running a clean campaign,” he said. “We don’t need dirty tricks.”

Even before this week, Sanders backers had accused the DNC of trying to protect Clinton by limiting the number and prominence of debates — a narrative that plays into his anti-establishment appeal.

“They’ve been sabotaging Bernie’s campaign all along,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, an 185,000-member union that is backing Sanders.

News of the data breach broke just as Sanders was enjoying a fresh burst of momentum after months in which his campaign appeared to have stalled.

On Thursday, Sanders received his biggest union endorsement to date, from the 700,000-member Communications Workers of America. He also was endorsed by Democracy for America, a progressive group that claims 1 million members nationwide. That group, founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who is backing Clinton, said it had surveyed its membership and found 88 percent favored endorsing Sanders.

Sanders, who has raised most of his money from small donors over the Internet, also this week celebrated a fundraising milestone: more than 2 million contributions to his campaign. That figure made him competitive with the effort of President Obama’s 2012 re-election effort during the same stretch.",REAL,the presidential campaign of sen bernie sanders of vermont filed a lawsuit

democraticleaning voters including data the campaign has gathered about its own supporters after midnight sanders and the dnc put out statements that both indicated the impasse had been resolved but that put remarkably different spins on the outcome sanderss campaign said the dnc had capitulated and that sanders would soon regain access to the data the dnc said what happened was completely unacceptable and that it would continue to investigate the circumstances even as sanders regained access to the valuable information without a quick resolution the messy public brawl threatened to overshadow saturdays third democratic presidential debate and cast doubt on the dncs ability to manage the sophisticated data tools necessary for the party to win the white house next year and it sparked significant suspicions among sanders supporters that the party was conspiring to give a boost to clinton dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz rejected that allegation friday alleging that sanders staffers had exploited a software error to essentially steal data from clintons campaign wasserman schultz said the party would not allow sanders access to the critical database again until his campaign agreed to an independent audit of what happened the suit filed in federal court in washington argued that under a contract between the dnc and the campaign governing the data systems use formal notice in writing is required if either side believes the other has violated the deal in addition each side is supposed to be allowed  days to address any concerns the suit said the dnc may not suspend the campaigns access to critical voter data out of haste or desperation to clean up after the dncs own mistakes the suit says the voter data is heavily used to raise money and the sanders campaign estimated that it is losing  a day in critical fundraising and publicity opportunities without access to the files the incident strained the relationship between the campaign of an upstart vermont senator who until this year has run as an independent and a national party his supporters have long accused of favoring clinton weaver accused the party of purposely sabotaging sanders by refusing to restore access to the voter information by their action the leadership of the democratic national committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign weaver said i think if you look at the pattern of conduct    it looks like in this case theyre trying to help the clinton campaign ngpvan the computer vendor that provides democrats with detailed information about voters has said that a computer error on wednesday briefly allowed the campaigns to review information that had been gathered by their rivals the company maintains a master voter list for the dnc and rents it to national and state campaigns which then add their own proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by rival campaigns the sanders campaign has acknowledged that several of its staffers probed the system during the time of the error cited by ngpvan one operative data director josh uretsky was fired as a result of the incident weaver said the actions of several others are being reviewed landing at the airport in manchester nh ahead of saturdays debate wasserman schultz said that sanders himself was unaware of the breach until she called to discuss it  hours after it took place he was stunned she said i know that sen sanders had absolutely nothing to do with this    unfortunately he has staff who acted inappropriately and they need to be held accountable the severity of the data breach itself remained an issue of serious dispute friday audit data from ngpvan and provided to the washington post by the clinton campaign showed that four sanders staffers conducted  separate searches of clinton data during a minute window wednesday targeting early voting states and searching for lists of voters most and least likely to support clinton the logs show that in some cases the staffers saved the search results in new folders created within the system this was a very egregious breach and our data was stolen this was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data clintons campaign manager robby mook told reporters on cnn clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon accused the sanders staffers of acting like kids in the candy store they went hog wild downloading as much data as they could he said later friday the clinton camp struck a more conciliatory tone issuing a statement in which fallon said that his campaign was hopeful the matter would be resolved friday night and that the sanders team would get access to its voter files right away uretsky told the post that he and the others conducted the searches of clinton data after they discovered the software glitch only in an effort to discover the extent of their own data exposure we intentionally did it in a way that was trackable and traceable so that when they did an audit they would be able to see exactly what we did he said uretsky said there was no attempt to take clinton information out of the software system weaver blamed the software vendor for the breach which allowed all campaigns to access one anothers data for a time insisting that the sanders campaign had actually quietly alerted the dnc to problems with another vendor system in october in the lawsuit the campaign argued that a similar security incident during the  presidential campaign resulted in unintentional transmission of confidential information to clintons unsuccessful presidential campaign against barack obama weaver said a ticktock provided to the sanders campaign by the computer vendor confirmed that staffers were not attempting to remove significant clinton data from the system we are running a clean campaign he said we dont need dirty tricks even before this week sanders backers had accused the dnc of trying to protect clinton by limiting the number and prominence of debates  a narrative that plays into his antiestablishment appeal theyve been sabotaging bernies campaign all along said roseann demoro executive director of national nurses united an member union that is backing sanders news of the data breach broke just as sanders was enjoying a fresh burst of momentum after months in which his campaign appeared to have stalled on thursday sanders received his biggest union endorsement to date from the member communications workers of america he also was endorsed by democracy for america a progressive group that claims  million members nationwide that group founded by former vermont governor howard dean who is backing clinton said it had surveyed its membership and found  percent favored endorsing sanders sanders who has raised most of his money from small donors over the internet also this week celebrated a fundraising milestone more than  million contributions to his campaign that figure made him competitive with the effort of president obamas  reelection effort during the same stretch,"['presidential', 'campaign', 'sen', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'vermont', 'filed', 'lawsuit', 'democratic',

2974.0,Why the latest Patriot Act reform won’t be enough to rein in the NSA,"Recent debates over US government spying have focused on one specific program: the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records — and the Patriot Act provision that supplied the program's legal justification. From that perspective, the partial expiration of the Patriot Act a week ago and the subsequent passage of surveillance reform legislation might seem like a decisive victory against mass surveillance.

But the surveillance debate is actually a lot bigger than the phone records program and the Patriot Act. The NSA has other spying programs with other legal foundations. And the USA Freedom Act, which President Obama signed on Tuesday, doesn't do anything to rein them in.

On Friday, I talked to John Napier Tye, a former State Department official who resigned last year over what he regards as unconstitutional surveillance by the US federal government. He sees the USA Freedom Act as ""a small step in the right direction,"" but he's hoping the next step will be a broader debate about other ways the US government spies on innocent Americans.

Most people have heard about the Patriot Act, which was signed just weeks after the 9/11 attacks, and was reformed this week by the USA Freedom Act. But Tye argues the real action is elsewhere.

""You have to keep in mind that most NSA collection on Americans was not under the Patriot Act. It was under other legal authorities. And none of that surveillance is affected by this new law,"" he says. ""When you think about all the collection that the NSA has been doing on Americans, a small percentage — 5 or 10 percent, maybe less — was under the Patriot Act.""

Tye points to two other sources of authority for government spying. One is the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which is the legal basis for a controversial NSA program called PRISM that collects private data from major internet companies like Google and Facebook. The other is Executive Order 12333, a Reagan-era directive that has become the basis for a lot of NSA spying.

Tye says that EO 12333 is ""an executive order, it's not a statute. It was never passed by Congress. It was originally issued by President Reagan in 1981 and has been amended several times since then — including by George W. Bush.""

A huge amount of our data is collected: Gmails and Yahoo messages, Facebook messages, Apple iMessages

EO 12333 ""gives a very broad grant of authority to intelligence agencies to do all kinds of things,"" Tye says. ""There's one section in there that allows the NSA to collect data on US persons as part of a lawful foreign intelligence investigation. That provision is being used to collect a huge amount of Americans' communications and data.""

When the government collects information overseas, it isn't bound by most US surveillance laws. The NSA has reserved the right to ""incidentally"" collect Americans' private communications overseas so long as Americans are not the target of a particular surveillance effort. But Tye argues that this is a huge loophole in practice.

""I don't think most Americans understand that almost all of their internet and phone data is either stored on backup servers overseas or transits outside of our borders,"" he says. ""A huge amount of our data is collected under this authority outside the borders of the US — Gmails and Yahoo messages, Facebook messages, Apple iMessages, Twitter, every service you can think of.""

Tye says he has firsthand knowledge of the extent of NSA spying programs. That's because he was an official in the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in 2013 when Edward Snowden's revelations became public.

""My jobs was internet freedom, promoting free and open internet around the world,"" Tye says. ""When the Snowden leaks happened in June of 2013, I was not surprised. I knew that a lot of stuff had been happening. I knew that a lot of surveillance was going on that no one knew about. And it didn't surprise me that this was finally front-page news.""

Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity

Tye says that after the Snowden leaks, ""part of my job was to help develop responses to initiatives within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly by Germany, Brazil, and other countries that were very concerned with online privacy. To be able to properly negotiate those efforts, I was briefed on the scope of US intelligence practices. In two different classified briefings, one in the fall of 2013 and one in the first part of 2014, I learned about activities under 12333.""

Tye believed these programs were unconstitutional and began filing complaints inside the government about them. He met with the intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate and filed complaints with the inspectors general of both the State Department and the National Security Agency. He says none of them were very interested in the issue.

So last summer, Tye quit his job and went public with his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He says he ran the op-ed through government censors to make sure it didn't disclose any classified information. Tye has spent the last year at the public interest group Avaaz and is now starting his own law firm that will focus on civil rights and human rights issues.

Tye would like President Obama to unilaterally revise Executive Order 12333 to better protect the privacy of Americans. If Obama doesn't, Tye would like Congress to hold hearings on the issue. ""I think that Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity under 12333,"" Tye says. ""Congress should hold hearings and find out what protections really exist for Americans and how much our data is being collected.""

He also favors reforms to the FISA Amendments Act, which was passed by Congress in 2008. Whereas some provisions of the Patriot Act were set to expire this year — and have now been renewed until 2019 — the FISA Amendments Act is permanent. The most controversial part of the FISA Amendments Act is Section 702, which allows warrantless surveillance to collect Americans' communications so long as the target is a foreigner located overseas.

""Under Section 702, the NSA is collecting a lot of stuff inside the United States that's nominally targeting foreigners but in fact is scooping up innocent communications from hundreds of millions of Americans,"" Tye says. Even worse, ""the FBI has access to that database and can search it for domestic criminal reasons. So the purpose of the law nominally was to allow the NSA to conduct foreign intelligence investigations. But as it's currently being used, the FBI is using this data for domestic criminal investigations. The protections that we normally want in place for domestic criminal investigations are not necessarily there.""",REAL,recent debates over us government spying have focused on one specific program the

3364.0,"FBI expands probe of Clinton emails, launches independent classification review","The FBI has expanded its probe of Hillary Clinton's emails, with agents exploring whether multiple statements violate a federal false statements statute, according to intelligence sources familiar with the ongoing case.

Fox News is told agents are looking at U.S. Code 18, Section 1001, which pertains to ""materially false"" statements given either in writing, orally or through a third party. Violations also include pressuring a third party to conspire in a cover-up. Each felony violation is subject to five years in prison.

This phase represents an expansion of the FBI probe, which is also exploring potential violations of an Espionage Act provision relating to ""gross negligence"" in the handling of national defense information.

""The agents involved are under a lot of pressure and are busting a--,"" an intelligence source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Fox News.

The section of the criminal code being explored is known as ""statements or entries generally,"" and can be applied when an individual makes misleading or false statements causing federal agents to expend additional resources and time. In this case, legal experts as well as a former FBI agent said, Section 1001 could apply if Clinton, her aides or attorney were not forthcoming with FBI agents about her emails, classification and whether only non-government records were destroyed. It is not publicly known who may have been interviewed.

Fox News judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said the same section got Martha Stewart in trouble with the FBI. To be a violation, the statements do not need to be given under oath.

""This is a broad, brush statute that punishes individuals who are not direct and fulsome in their answers,"" former FBI intelligence officer Timothy Gill told Fox News. Gill is not connected to the email investigation, but spent 16 years as part of the bureau's national security branch, and worked the post 9/11 anthrax case where considerable time was spent resolving discrepancies in Bruce Ivins' statements and his unusual work activities at Fort Detrick, Md.

""It is a cover-all. The problem for a defendant is when their statements cause the bureau to expend more time, energy, resources to de-conflict their statements with the evidence,"" he said.

Separately, two U.S. government officials told Fox News that the FBI is doing its own classification review of the Clinton emails, effectively cutting out what has become a grinding process at the State Department. Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy has argued to both Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Congress that the ""Top Secret"" emails on Clinton's server could have been pulled from unclassified sources including news reports.

""You want to go right to the source,"" Gill said. ""Go to the originating, not the collateral, authority. Investigative protocol would demand that.""

On Friday, Clapper spokesman Brian Hale confirmed that no change has been made to the two ""Top Secrets"" emails after a Politico report said the intelligence community was retreating from the finding.

""ODNI has made no such determination and the review is ongoing,"" Hale said. Andrea G. Williams, spokeswoman for the intelligence community inspector general, said she had the same information. Kennedy is seeking an appeal, but no one can explain what statute or executive order would give Clapper that authority.

A U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record said the FBI is identifying suspect emails, and then going directly to the agencies who originated them and therefore own the intelligence -- and who, under the regulations, have final say on the classification.

As Fox News previously reported, at least four classified Clinton emails had their markings changed to a category that shields the content from Congress and the public, in what State Department whistleblowers believed to be an effort to hide the true extent of classified information on the former secretary of state's server.

One State Department lawyer involved in the alleged re-categorization was Kate Duval. Duval once worked in the same law firm as Clinton's current and long-time lawyer David Kendall and at the IRS during the Lois Lerner email controversy. Duval left government service for private practice in mid-September.

4933.0,Where is Gary Johnson?,"(CNN) Conservatives dissatisfied with Donald Trump have given the Libertarian presidential nominee a chance to take his third party to center stage, but Gary Johnson has not exactly been a fixture on the campaign trail.

Largely eschewing traditional campaign events, the former New Mexico governor has instead opted to appear almost daily on multiple news programs and appeal to his solid core of online support.

That could soon change as the campaign considers more regular appearances in the real world.

Johnson campaign spokesperson Joe Hunter told CNN Monday the campaign is now undergoing a ""natural evolution,"" having recently ramped up its fundraising efforts with the stated intention of buying advertisements in key states and beginning to hold rallies across the country.

Despite enjoying a brief surge in the lead-up to the major party conventions, Johnson has generally hovered in the high single digits in national polls. The latest CNN Poll of Polls showed Johnson at 9% support nationwide.

In a race where the majority of voters say they are dissatisfied with their mainstream offerings for president, where the Republican nominee has secured little support from the nation's largest generation -- millennials -- and where digital media has taken an unprecedented place in the political landscape, here's what Johnson is -- and isn't -- doing to make his long shot candidacy a viable bet.

Hunter called the constant interviews ""a critical"" component of the campaign, and after taking scheduling into account, ""We take every opportunity we get.""

Similar to Trump, Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, have relied on ""earned media"" in the form of appearances in the press.

Unlike Trump, the two almost always stay on message.

Since winning the nomination at the Libertarian Party's convention in May, Johnson and Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, have used their appearances to cast themselves as the centrist candidates between Trump and Hillary Clinton.

They point out their experience as Republican governors in traditionally Democratic-leaning states. Johnson often touts his laissez-faire approach to drugs and immigration, while Weld has pointed to his record on LGBT rights and his cordial relationship with both sides of the aisle, including the Clintons. Both champion their conservative credos on matters of spending.

But the live television appearances, including two prime-time town hall events on CNN, have not yet afforded the Libertarian ticket national recognition or a strong showing in the polls.

On the digital side, the Johnson campaign has largely stuck to its roots by embracing the Libertarian community online. Reaching supporters through social media and email, the campaign has kept its base abreast of its progress -- and appealed for funds.

The Johnson campaign said Tuesday its August ""money bomb"" fundraising campaign surpassed its goal of $1.5 million based off ""entirely digital"" appeals for money. The campaign said it raised $840,000 on Monday alone, totaling $2.9 million in donations in the first two weeks of the month.

A number of groups have fallen into place doing some of the heavy lifting that the long shot bid needs doing.

Among the most standout recent entries into the Johnson orbit is a newly minted group called Republicans for Johnson/Weld. The group formed this month to bring the GOP leaders and voters Trump had alienated into the Libertarian fold.

Republican strategist and group spokesperson Liz Mair told CNN Monday the pro-Johnson forces seeking to convert Republicans from a divisive nominee were in uncharted waters.

""I don't think anybody's tried to launch an effort like this,"" Mair said.

Despite the lack of an established path, Johnson has notched a few victories. Rep. Scott Rigell said he will support Johnson in November, and Reps. Reid Ribble and Mike Coffman have said they are considering it.

In separate interviews, Hunter and Mair both said they had heard supportive words from Republican politicians but that many were not ready to come out into the open against their party.

The outside group could be a key factor in the mainstreaming of Johnson. It already holds several well-known Republican staffers. On Monday, it added Joseph Russo III, a former Sarah Palin aide, Mair said.

Given the nature of the group, Mair said a ""number of us have better connections"" to GOP Capitol Hill figures than the Libertarian campaign.

What will Mitt Romney do?

Within the Johnson campaign, Weld has taken the lead on outreach to Republicans. However, his biggest prize still eludes him: 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

Romney served as governor of Massachusetts after Weld and has said if Weld were topping the ticket, he would be supporting them, but he still needed to hear what Johnson had to say. Months have passed since then without a Romney endorsement.

The Libertarian efforts to sway Republicans have also had to push back against the notion they are helping Clinton.

Johnson has said he is pulling about evenly from both sides and been forceful in his condemnation of Trump.

Mair said Trump was doing the work of helping Clinton on his own and that Clinton's win was at this point ""overwhelming likely,"" although Johnson still had a chance in an unpredictable cycle.

""The Republicans screwed up. That's not Gary Johnson's fault,"" she said.

Up in the air

Hunter said many people would not come to their side until the Johnson candidacy had reached a ""critical mass,"" which they hope to achieve by ramping up their campaign efforts and their ad spending.

In addition to television ads, the campaign said it was looking at radio, billboards and continuing its online efforts.

As with the major party candidates, outside spending groups have also taken it upon themselves to launch ads in support of Johnson. A Libertarian spending group called Americans Deserve Better PAC has put together a few spots hailing the former governors as the ""adults"" in the race.

Republicans for Johnson/Weld, meanwhile, said its focus is less on traditional advertising than generating viral content. So far, however, one of the group's most viral moments came not from distributed content, but from an appearance on CNN. Ahead of the second Libertarian town hall, Mair told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Trump's message ""is being a loud-mouthed d---, basically.""

All told, this third party effort has so far expounded more resources on general election advertisements than Trump's campaign, which has yet to join in the air wars.

All of these efforts have so far been dwarfed by Clinton and her allied super PACs, which have spent exponentially more than the three other presidential campaigns.

Johnson has not been able to draw the kind of rock star crowd sizes that Trump or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attracted earlier this year.

The former New Mexico governor held one rally in Utah on a Saturday earlier this month and another in Reno, Nevada. After rescheduling, he is set to hold another in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this Saturday.

His campaign said it was still working out specifics on other rallies in the near future but that it planned to host public events soon in Florida and New England.

Meanwhile, fundraising efforts have come largely from the digital side, although the campaign said the governors have appealed directly for funds, with a planned event in Miami on Wednesday.

Their most prominent fundraising event so far came in late July at a Hollywood event hosted by Drew Carey, the Libertarian host of ""The Price is Right.""",REAL,cnn conservatives dissatisfied with

I have many questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area..In terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldn't there be more of an impact? I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth.. with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once? Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly (with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours) if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter? I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain better.Another question.. I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why it's true. [ link to heiwaco.tripod.com ] Personally I find it's safer to believe they work, if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value. You don't want to question them about it or dare them to prove it!In terms of world 3... have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline? I would be lying if I said I'm not scared. When it comes to death. .it sucks sure but I'm not afraid for myself.. I'm afraid for my one year old! I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful, healthy, long life! I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I can't help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world.. for what? So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3? I just feel so lost and hurt. If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know. The aspect of the end being at our door isn't too much a problem for me.. it's more the aspect that I don't want this for my child! I want her to live her life! Fall in love! See the world!I don't know.. maybe the time isn't here.. we've been close to a nuclear war once before maybe just maybe we can dodge this again.

10490.0,Kevin MacDonald celebrates Trump’s Amazing Victory,"“WE ARE THE FUTURE.” — Kevin MacDonald 
This is an amazing victory. The stars were aligned. First, the very long shot of Trump being nominated. Then he gets to run against the most corrupt, least charismatic candidate in history (I think Joe Biden would have beaten Trump, and maybe even Bernie Sanders) at a time when Americans naturally want change after 8 years of Obama. 
Fundamentally, it is a victory of White Americans over the oligarchic, hostile elites what have run this country for decades. Trump accomplished a hostile takeover of the Republican Party and won without the support or with only lukewarm and vacillating support from much of the GOP elite. 
In May of 2015 I was very despondent about our prospects. It just didn’t seem like we could break through the elite consensus dominating all the high ground—and all the moral high ground—of the U.S., including the media (print, television, and the Hollywood movie industry), the academic world, politics, Wall St., and the CEOs of major corporations. We were systematically shut out and it was obvious that the powers that be were not going to let the Alt Right get a seat at the table. Then Trump announced, it was hard to take it seriously, but his comments on immigration, American nationalism, political correctness and trade certainly struck a chord. My immediate reaction (July 10, 2015), however, was that he had two things going for him that were absolutely unique — he is a celebrity and he is very, very rich (“ How it could happen “). Such a person is in a position to be heard; he can’t be shut out of the media, and he doesn’t need the money of the corrupt donor class. In fact, the media, eager for ratings, gave him countless opportunities to get his message out. Anyone on the Alt Right could have said the exact same things, but we would be speaking into our closets. 
Even back in July of 2015, it was obvious Trump was not your usual GOP candidate: 
[Trump] certainly did not fall in my estimation when he attacked two prominent operatives of the Republican Party/Israel Lobby nexus hostile to his candidacy, Charles Krauthammer and Jonah Goldberg. Then there’s the Twitter incident : “I promise you that I’m much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz — I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow,” tweeted Trump , adding, “Who, by the way, is totally overrated.” It is, of course, considered “anti-Semitic” to ever call attention to the fact that someone is Jewish because of the absolutely outrageous suggestion that the Jewish identity of someone like Stewart/Leibowitz might influence his opinions. As we all know, Jews are just like everybody else. 
And it quickly turned out that he understood the anger in White America far better than anyone else and he was willing to say what they wanted to hear — most of all the White working class (72-23!), but also White women(53-43), and his deficit among White educated women was only 51-45 ( CBS exit polls ). Looks like quite a few college-educated women ignored what they heard in their gender studies courses and those mandatory credits in Black Studies. 
While obviously a lot of work needs to be done, this is a glorious day. 
The following is an expanded version of my article in Radix Journal’s series on the meaning of Trump. 
The Alt Right has gravitated to Trump’s candidacy, and for good reason. Much of what the Alt Right wants will be difficult or impossible to bring about even with a president who is entirely on board with the idea that America should start thinking about the interests of its traditional White majority. But win or lose, Trump has already had a huge effect on American politics in a way that benefits the Alt Right, and his victory will be even more so: Trump has made statements on immigration that have been banned from polite society for 50 years — deport illegals, seal the border, end birthright citizenship, place a moratorium on Muslim immigration, and make immigration serve actual labor needs rather than a moral imperative (ideally with guest workers not given citizenship). He has deplored Angela Merkel’s policies in Germany and has made statements indicating he opposes the transformation of Western societies via immigration and multiculturalism (“ Paris isn’t Paris anymore .”) Trump’s victory will encourage and energize the right in Europe. It is Brexit on steroids — a scream by voters to stop the way things are going. To stop the destruction of their traditional ways of life. If nothing else, it is throwing a monkey wrench into the system. Tear it down! We can’t keep going on like this! Voters want an end to meaningless wars, an end to importing people who hate us and will never assimilate to our way of life. Trump has unmasked the neocons. The neocons have dominated the intellectual and foreign policy establishment of the Republican Party since the 1980s. From the beginning of Trump’s candidacy, neocons have been leading the #NeverTrump movement, despite the catastrophic effects of a Hillary Clinton presidency on the GOP. A Clinton presidency would ensure a liberal/left voting majority into the foreseeable future given that she would amnesty millions of illegals and dramatically raise total numbers of immigrants and refugees. Clinton Supreme Court appointments would likely gut the First Amendment by enabling “hate speech” laws and they would gut the Second Amendment as well. No one on the right, from traditional “limited government” conservatives to the Alt Right, would want this, and it’s difficult to believe that the Jewish identities and pro-Israel commitments of the most important neocons are lost on non-Jewish Republicans. The treason of the neocons will be long remembered in GOP circles and will compromise their influence in the future. 
I notice on Twitter that Bill Kristol says that the #NeverTrumpers should be magnanimous in losing, but I would be shocked if neocons were given any role in the GOP. This is Trump’s party now. It is incredibly heartening that he wants a good relationship with Russia at a time when neocons and NATO have been clamoring for confrontation and aggression. It is incredibly heartening that he supports the legitimate Assad government in Syria. I have no doubt that he will act in concert with Russia to end the rebellion and bring peace and stability to the region. Trump has highlighted the chasm between the overwhelmingly White Republican voting base and the GOP donor class intent on globalist policies of mass immigration, free trade, and a bellicose pro-Israel, anti-Russian foreign policy. The pre-Trump GOP was dominated by a neocon foreign policy establishment and a pro-Chamber of Commerce, pro-big business economic policy. This party did not represent the interests of GOP voters and can’t be resurrected. Even if Trump had lost, his energized supporters would be a new and important force within the GOP. His victory will ensure that the GOP will be a populist party for the foreseeable future. Trump has unmasked the media. The media have always been liberal, but this time around, even much of the usual pro-Republican media has been hostile to Trump, and a survey by the Media Research Center found an astounding 91% of media coverage hostile to his candidacy. Who can forget the hostility from mainstream conservative media like National Review , The Weekly Standard , and other neocon outlets? This feeds into the narrative that there has been a unified establishment from the far left to the neoconservative right that has opposed Trump’s populist policies favoring the middle class and the traditional White majority. 
The media is a pillar of the establishment, and it is heartening indeed that people ignored the deluge of talk of Trump being a racist, a bigot, and a misogynist. The media is a huge loser in Trump’s victory. 
As we have commented many times, the media is under very powerful Jewish influence. Trump’s victory is a blow to the entire Jewish power structure. I have written 6 articles on Jewish hostility toward Trump, much of this hostility bordering on the clinically paranoid. Jews understand that they do indeed have a great deal of power in the U.S. and throughout the West and that they have used that power to destroy the traditional homogeneity of these societies and to do all they can to make Whites minorities in societies they have dominated for hundreds and, in the case of Europe, many thousands of years. We are a long way from really putting a dent in that power structure, but Trump’s victory is a great first step. Trump has put the Alt Right on the map. There have been numerous articles and commentary on the Alt Right because of Trump’s candidacy. The Alt Right has been the only identifiable intellectual perspective supporting Trump, although we understand that he is not one of us and would not attempt to do much what we would like to see in our ideal world. We are the only intellectual perspective that takes race seriously and accepts the social science research not only on race but on the disastrous costs of imposed multiculturalism for White majorities and the horrifying future awaiting Whites if indeed they do become hated, despised minorities. Traditional conservative intellectuals simply cannot explain what is happening with their usual intellectual toolkit. They can’t explain the anger and the very legitimate fears of the White majority. They can’t understand the racialization of politics. We understand it and are able to analyze it in very sophisticated ways that are entirely within the scientific mainstream. 
Much of the media coverage of the Alt Right was motivated by attempting to tar Trump as a “racist,” and after the election, win or lose, the media will likely attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube by ceasing coverage. However, a Trump victory makes that all but impossible. Our increased visibility has meant a very large surge in support for the Alt Right. Meeting attendance is way up, and readership on Alt Right sites is skyrocketing. The future is bright, and a very large amount of the credit for that has to go to Donald Trump.

foreign policy the pretrump gop was dominated by a neocon foreign policy establishment and a prochamber of commerce probig business economic policy this party did not represent the interests of gop voters and cant be resurrected even if trump had lost his energized supporters would be a new and important force within the gop his victory will ensure that the gop will be a populist party for the foreseeable future trump has unmasked the media the media have always been liberal but this time around even much of the usual prorepublican media has been hostile to trump and a survey by the media research center found an astounding  of media coverage hostile to his candidacy who can forget the hostility from mainstream conservative media like national review  the weekly standard  and other neocon outlets this feeds into the narrative that there has been a unified establishment from the far left to the neoconservative right that has opposed trumps populist policies favoring the middle class and the traditional white majority the media is a pillar of the establishment and it is heartening indeed that people ignored the deluge of talk of trump being a racist a bigot and a misogynist the media is a huge loser in trumps victory as we have commented many times the media is under very powerful jewish influence trumps victory is a blow to the entire jewish power structure i have written  articles on jewish hostility toward trump much of this hostility bordering on the clinically paranoid jews understand that they do indeed have a great deal of power in the us and throughout the west and that they have used that power to destroy the traditional homogeneity of these societies and to do all they can to make whites minorities in societies they have dominated for hundreds and in the case of europe many thousands of years we are a long way from really putting a dent in that power structure but trumps victory is a great first step trump has put the alt right on the map there have been numerous articles and commentary on the alt right because of trumps candidacy the alt right has been the only identifiable intellectual perspective supporting trump although we understand that he is not one of us and would not attempt to do much what we would like to see in our ideal world we are the only intellectual perspective that takes race seriously and accepts the social science research not only on race but on the disastrous costs of imposed multiculturalism for white majorities and the horrifying future awaiting whites if indeed they do become hated despised minorities traditional conservative intellectuals simply cannot explain what is happening with their usual intellectual toolkit they cant explain the anger and the very legitimate fears of the white majority they cant understand the racialization of politics we understand it and are able to analyze it in very sophisticated ways that are entirely within the scientific mainstream much of the media coverage of the alt right was motivated by attempting to tar trump as a racist and after the election win or lose the media will likely attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube by ceasing coverage however a trump victory makes that all but impossible our increased visibility has meant a very large surge in support for the alt right meeting attendance is way up and readership on alt right sites is skyrocketing the future is bright and a very large amount of the credit for that has to go to donald trump we are the future,"['future', 'kevin', 'macdonald', 'amazing', 'victory', 'stars',

4880.0,What happens if Clinton drops out?,"Whether an October surprise may have come a month early, it’s too soon to say.

But Hillary Clinton’s weekend health scare already has started to stir speculation about whether Democratic officials should be discussing the possibility of a Plan B, in case they need to hastily arrange for a replacement nominee.

Which raises a basic question: How does that work?

Democratic Party bylaws say the DNC has the power to fill “vacancies in the nominations for the office of the president and vice president” when the national convention is not in session.

Under party rules, the DNC chair – currently Donna Brazile – could call a special meeting, and fill the vacancy by a majority vote of those present.

Analysts still see this scenario as exceedingly unlikely. It appears party leaders have no authority to sideline Clinton, meaning the special meeting would kick in only if she were to step aside voluntarily. The nominee and her aides say she's recovering and feeling much better now.

But after Clinton left a 9/11 memorial Sunday stumbling and being helped into an SUV by multiple aides -- an incident the campaign tied to a recent pneumonia diagnosis and other factors -- some Democrats are at least thinking about that process.

Former DNC Chairman Don Fowler told Politico that the party needs to develop a plan immediately for finding a potential successor candidate.

Former Al Jazeera and MSNBC anchor David Shuster tweeted Sunday that the DNC was considering an “emergency meeting” to talk about a Clinton replacement, although his source emphasized her status as nominee was up to her, not the party.

NPR’s Cokie Roberts said Monday that Democrats already are considering another candidate.

“It has them very nervously beginning to whisper about having her step aside and finding another candidate,” Roberts said, adding that “it’s unlikely to be a real thing” and describing the talk as likely “an overreaction.”

Perhaps inadvertently feeding that frenzy, former Ohio Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland introduced Clinton running mate Tim Kaine at an event Monday by describing him as “ready to become the president” if necessary, The Columbus Dispatch reported.

But in the, albeit unlikely, scenario of a replacement scramble, Kaine isn’t necessarily a shoo-in.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others could all be possible candidates.

Historian Doug Wead told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto that the votes would tend to go toward whomever the top of the ticket endorses, though it’s not guaranteed.

“Whatever [Clinton] says will likely hold sway, but legally, technically they have their own vote,” he said.

Replacing a member of a major-party ticket would be exceedingly rare, though not unprecedented. This happened in 1972 when Democratic nominee George McGovern’s running mate -- Sen. Thomas Eagleton -- withdrew from the race in July after it was revealed he had undergone electric shock treatment for mental health issues.

Eagleton was replaced in August by Sargent Shriver as the new vice presidential nominee. The McGovern/Shriver ticket went on to lose the race in a landslide to incumbent President Richard Nixon.

Rick Hasen, who runs the Election Law Blog, told FoxNews.com that the situation could become significantly more complicated if it were to play out later in the calendar.

“The more complicated problem would arise if ballots have already been printed, and people would have started voting. There, the Electoral College would come into play, and electors from the party would be expected to vote for the replacement nominee,” Hasen said.

The first absentee ballots were mailed out in Sept. 9 in North Carolina, and many other states will soon follow. By mid-September the deadlines for both parties to certify candidates for the general election will have passed in every state – meaning lawsuits might have to be filed to try and get a replacement on the ballot.

The DNC did not respond to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.

This isn’t the first time this election cycle there has been talk of a candidate dropping out. In August, during a particularly rough patch of poll numbers for Trump, some GOP officials were reportedly considering contingency plans in case the Republican nominee dropped out.

factors  some democrats are at least thinking about that process former dnc chairman don fowler told politico that the party needs to develop a plan immediately for finding a potential successor candidate former al jazeera and msnbc anchor david shuster tweeted sunday that the dnc was considering an emergency meeting to talk about a clinton replacement although his source emphasized her status as nominee was up to her not the party nprs cokie roberts said monday that democrats already are considering another candidate it has them very nervously beginning to whisper about having her step aside and finding another candidate roberts said adding that its unlikely to be a real thing and describing the talk as likely an overreaction perhaps inadvertently feeding that frenzy former ohio democratic gov ted strickland introduced clinton running mate tim kaine at an event monday by describing him as ready to become the president if necessary the columbus dispatch reported but in the albeit unlikely scenario of a replacement scramble kaine isnt necessarily a shooin vermont sen bernie sanders vice president joe biden massachusetts sen elizabeth warren and others could all be possible candidates historian doug wead told fox news neil cavuto that the votes would tend to go toward whomever the top of the ticket endorses though its not guaranteed whatever clinton says will likely hold sway but legally technically they have their own vote he said replacing a member of a majorparty ticket would be exceedingly rare though not unprecedented this happened in  when democratic nominee george mcgoverns running mate  sen thomas eagleton  withdrew from the race in july after it was revealed he had undergone electric shock treatment for mental health issues eagleton was replaced in august by sargent shriver as the new vice presidential nominee the mcgovernshriver ticket went on to lose the race in a landslide to incumbent president richard nixon rick hasen who runs the election law blog told foxnewscom that the situation could become significantly more complicated if it were to play out later in the calendar the more complicated problem would arise if ballots have already been printed and people would have started voting there the electoral college would come into play and electors from the party would be expected to vote for the replacement nominee hasen said the first absentee ballots were mailed out in sept  in north carolina and many other states will soon follow by midseptember the deadlines for both parties to certify candidates for the general election will have passed in every state  meaning lawsuits might have to be filed to try and get a replacement on the ballot the dnc did not respond to a request for comment from foxnewscom this isnt the first time this election cycle there has been talk of a candidate dropping out in august during a particularly rough patch of poll numbers for trump some gop officials were reportedly considering contingency plans in case the republican nominee dropped out adam shaw is a politics reporter and occasional opinion writer for foxnewscom he can be reached here or on twitter adamshawny,"['whether',

3512.0,Brothers ID'd as suicide bombers in Belgium,"(CNN) Several bombers are dead. At least one alleged attacker is still on the loose.

And a key question looms as investigators race to piece together details about the attackers behind Tuesday's deadly bombings in Belgium's capital: Were these men acting alone, or were other members of a terror cell supporting them?

Raids, arrests and forensic analysis are some of the tools investigators are using to get to the bottom of who was behind the attacks in Brussels, which killed 31 people and wounded 270 others.

Two of the bombers were brothers. And one of the bombers at the airport appears to be a man authorities named as a suspect in the Paris terror attacks.

But the investigation is far from finished. With at least one suspect on the run, the stakes are high, Belgian counterterrorism official Paul Van Tigchelt said Wednesday.

""There are still a number of people, possibly involved in the attacks still in our country ... who still pose a threat,"" he said.

Here's a look at the latest developments in the investigation, and the questions they raise.

Belgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw identified Ibrahim El Bakraoui as one of two suicide bombers at the Brussels airport and his brother, Khalid El Bakraoui, as the man behind a deadly suicide blast about an hour later on a train near the Maelbeek metro station.

This isn't the first time they've come across authorities' radar.

Ibrahim El Bakraoui was deported by Turkey to the Netherlands last year, a senior Turkish official told CNN. The Turkish presidency's office said authorities there captured him in July 2015 and flagged him to Belgian authorities.

Belgian authorities, the Turkish official said, responded soon after saying he had a criminal record but no known ties to terrorism.

""These two deceased suicide bombers had lengthy criminal records,"" he said, ""but (were) not linked to terrorism.""

Ibrahim El Bakraoui had been sentenced in October 2010 by a Brussels criminal court to nine years behind bars for opening fire on police officers with a Kalashnikov during a robbery, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF and CNN affiliate RTL.

Interpol had issued a ""red notice"" for Khalid El Bakraoui, the subway bomber, that noted Belgian authorities wanted him in connection with terrorism. But it wasn't clear when that notice was issued or why Belgian authorities now say he had no ties to terrorism.

Question to consider: If they were already on authorities' radar, how did the brothers manage to slip through the cracks and carry out the deadly attacks?

Surveillance images showing three men pushing luggage carts through the airport have played an important role as authorities work to pinpoint the suspects.

Authorities say bomber Ibrahim El Bakraoui is the man in the middle. Najim Laachraoui, an ISIS bomb-maker, is the man on the left in the picture, a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN's Paul Cruickshank.

Investigators believe both were killed in the airport blast. But authorities are looking for the third man in the photo, walking on the right and wearing light-colored clothing and a hat.

Belgium's interior minister said that man placed a bomb at the airport and left.

While two explosives went off within 37 seconds of each other shortly before 8 a.m., this third bomb -- described as the ""heaviest"" by Van Leeuw -- did not, instead being detonated by authorities later in a controlled explosion.

Questions to consider: Where did the man in light-colored clothing go? Is anyone helping him hide out from authorities, and could he be plotting another attack?

Two people were arrested in Brussels in connection with the attacks -- one in Schaerbeek and the other in Haren, Van Leeuw said.

One was released later that day, according to the prosecutor.

Another person was detained Wednesday, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF.

One raid, officials said, came after a tip from a taxi driver led them to the northeast Brussels area of Schaerbeek.

The driver recognized the men shown in surveillance footage and told authorities he'd driven the men to the airport before the attacks. Police raided the area where the driver told them he'd picked up the men.

On Wednesday, they made another significant find: Ibrahim El Bakraoui's will.

Police found the airport bomber's will on a computer in a trash can in Schaerbeek, Van Leeuw said.

The will indicated Bakraoui ""needs to rush"" and ""no longer feels safe.""

Questions to consider: Who are the people who were arrested, and what was their alleged role in the attacks?

The latest connection: Laachraoui, a suspect in the Paris attacks who authorities now say they believe was one of the Brussels airport bombers.

Investigators believe Abdeslam likely planned to be part of an attack orchestrated by the same ISIS cell that carried out Tuesday's attacks, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official told Cruickshank.

The Brussels attackers likely accelerated their plans when police discovered Abdeslam's hideout, investigators believe.

And one of the apartments where he hid before his capture, located in the southern Brussels district of Forest, allegedly has ties to one of the Bakraoui brothers.

Questions to consider: What role, if any, did Abeslam's arrest play in the Brussels attacks? Are there other links between the Paris and Brussels attacks?

Another piece of evidence authorities found during the Brussels raids could help in their investigation: unused explosives.

In the Schaerbeek residence, authorities found 15 kilograms of the explosive TATP and screws among the bomb-making materials there, Van Leeuw said.

""Such bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the West for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire, unlike military-grade explosives, which are tightly controlled in much of the West,"" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said.

TATP-based bombs require technical know-how and bulk purchases of hydrogen peroxide or hair bleach. That helps authorities narrow down potential bomb-making suspects, because making the explosives can sometimes bleach hair. So authorities can identify bomb-makers in part by recognizing unusually bleached hair or asking sellers to report any suspiciously large purchases of hydrogen peroxide.

Questions to consider: Will the bomb-making materials lead investigators to any new suspects or help them dismantle a terror cell?",REAL,cnn several bombers are dead at least one alleged attacker is

8685.0,Glorifying Violence,"opednews.com - Advertisement - The news in the Guardian (June 18) that 'The government has been secretly awarding honours to senior figures in the US military and foreign businessmen ' shows the importance we Brits attach to honoring people. Arise Sir George There is also a lot in the news just now about 'glorifying violence ' and I assume it mainly concerns anyone else who glorifies it, because we Brits have been at it for hundreds of years and do it better than most.I heard a story about the youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross a century ago. He was eighteen and when his maxim gun had jammed had bravely relied on a standard high velocity rifle to continue shooting the unfortunate Pathans, or whoever we were ""supporting"" at the time. He was cashiered for insubordination. He could cope with third world guys with spears, but not being told to get his flippin ' 'air cut. You are more likely to do your bravery when you are young and vulnerable and fear of a sergeant outweighs any feelings of fear of, or sympathy towards, your fellow human beings. ""Right lads we are about to walk across no man 's land, and I would like you chaps to consider coming with me. "" will not get results. ""OK, you shower of girl 's blouses, I will personally shoot the last mincer out of this trench. "" is likely to work, as long as the last guy who dared to debate the proposal, has not yet been removed from the barbed wire.

Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

2546.0,Don't blame all immigrants for San Francisco shooting,"Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend, there was grim news from San Francisco. On Wednesday night, Kate Steinle , 31, was fatally shot, apparently randomly, while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, who CNN reported was in the country without documentation, was arrested in her death.

Illegally re-entering the country after being deported, as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done, is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific, violent crime. And according to immigration authorities, he has seven other felony convictions, including four for drug offenses.

But that doesn't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border (illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low). He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society.

Lopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us.

It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.

Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families.

Consider that several mass shootings, from Aurora to Newtown to Charleston, were committed by young white men. Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers? Of course not.

The same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. In 2013, an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island, New York, amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy.

One takeaway from this episode is that deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, and yet he was still here in the country without authorization.

Back in 2011, the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $12,500 to deport a person. Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman.

Another lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement. Up to now, immigration authorities have wasted time, manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as, say, gardeners and maids, while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks.

That's why it was good news last week that the Department of Homeland Security announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals.

This move is a step in the right direction, because it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety. The government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers and terrorism threats.

True, Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should have at least been behind bars. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest and he was released in accordance with city law in March.

What's more, President Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez.

2596.0,Netanyahu: I Won't Allow Israel to Be 'Submerged' by Refugees,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he would not allow Israel to be ""submerged"" by refugees after calls for the Jewish state to take in those fleeing Syria's war.

Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu also announced the start of construction of a fence along Israel's border with Jordan, according to his office.

""We will not allow Israel to be submerged by a wave of illegal migrants and terrorist activists,"" Netanyahu said.

""Israel is not indifferent to the human tragedy of Syrian and African refugees... but Israel is a small country — very small — without demographic or geographic depth. That is why we must control our borders.""

Opposition leader Isaac Herzog on Saturday said Israel should take in Syrian refugees, recalling the plight of Jews who sought refuge from past conflicts.

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas also called for Israel to allow Palestinians from refugee camps in Syria to travel to the Palestinian territories, whose external borders are controlled by the Jewish state.

There is already hostility in Israel toward asylum-seekers from Africa and a concerted government effort to repatriate them.

Rights groups say thousands of African asylum seekers have been coerced into ""voluntary"" departures.

Official figures show 45,000 illegal immigrants are in Israel, almost all from Eritrea and Sudan. Most of those not in detention live in poor areas of southern Tel Aviv, where there have been several protests against them.

The start of construction of the 30-kilometer (19-mile) fence announced by Netanyahu involves extension of a security barrier to part of its eastern border with Jordan in a bid to keep out militants and illegal migrants.

Netanyahu said when it was approved in June that the new fence was a continuation of a 240-kilometer barrier built along the Egyptian border which ""blocked the entry of illegal migrants into Israel and the various terrorist movements"".

In its first stage, the new fence is being built along Israel's eastern border between Eilat and where a new airport will be built in the Timna Valley.

""We will continue the fence up to the Golan Heights,"" Netanyahu said.

That would take it into the Israeli-occupied West Bank along the Jordan Valley, an area which is already under Israeli military control but is claimed by the Palestinians as part of their state.

Israel has insisted on maintaining troops in the area in any final peace agreement, a stance completely rejected by the Palestinians who say it would be a violation of their sovereignty and merely perpetuate the occupation.

Israel also has a fence that runs along the Syrian frontier through the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

Those fences are in addition to a barrier that runs through the West Bank, which Israel began building during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, which lasted from 2000-2005.

Israel seized 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) of the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War and annexed it 14 years later, in a move never recognized by the international community.",REAL,prime minister benjamin netanyahu on sunday said he would not allow israel to be submerged by refugees after calls for the jewish state to take in those fleeing syrias war speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting netanyahu also announced the start of construction of a fence along israels border with jordan according to his office we will not allow israel to be submerged by a wave of illegal migrants and terrorist activists netanyahu said israel is not indifferent to the human tragedy of syrian and african refugees but israel is a small country  very small  without demographic or geographic depth that is why we must control our borders opposition leader isaac herzog on saturday said israel should take in syrian refugees recalling the plight of jews who sought refuge from past conflicts palestinian president mahmud abbas also called for israel to allow palestinians from refugee camps in syria to travel to the palestinian territories whose external borders are controlled by the jewish state there is already hostility in israel toward asylumseekers from africa and a concerted government effort to repatriate them rights groups say thousands of african asylum seekers have been coerced into voluntary departures official figures show  illegal immigrants are in israel almost all from eritrea and sudan most of those not in detention live in poor areas of southern tel aviv where there have been several protests against them the start of construction of the kilometer mile fence announced by netanyahu involves extension of a security barrier to part of its eastern border with jordan in a bid to keep out militants and illegal migrants netanyahu said when it was approved in june that the new fence was a continuation of a kilometer barrier built along the egyptian border which blocked the entry of illegal migrants into israel and the various terrorist movements in its first stage the new fence is being built along israels eastern border between eilat and where a new airport will be built in the timna valley we will continue the fence up to the golan heights netanyahu said that would take it into the israelioccupied west bank along the jordan valley an area which is already under israeli military control but is claimed by the palestinians as part of their state israel has insisted on maintaining troops in the area in any final peace agreement a stance completely rejected by the palestinians who say it would be a violation of their sovereignty and merely perpetuate the occupation israel also has a fence that runs along the syrian frontier through the israelioccupied golan heights those fences are in addition to a barrier that runs through the west bank which israel began building during the second palestinian intifada or uprising which lasted

There’s nothing wrong with being passionate when it comes to your political beliefs and the candidate you support. In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. 
Take for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : “People are going to march on the capitols. They’re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. “If push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.” 
Roger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: “It’s not what I’m going to do, but I’m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I’ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white — there’s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there’s no together. The country has never been so divided. I’m looking at revolution right now.” 
As Trump continues to talk of the election being “rigged,” his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: “If she comes after the guns, it’s going to be a rough, bumpy road. I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won’t hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.” 
Retired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he’s ready to do whatever is necessary: “I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.” 
See if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be “heroes” in their own minds. The year was 1995 and Bill Clinton was President. Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck loaded with explosives outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 innocent Americans, including children. Words can have consequences.

By Alex Kirby / Climate News Network Biofilm used in research into carbon capture: Doubts persist about geo-engineering. (ENERGY.GOV via Wikimedia Commons) 
LONDON—The global watchdog responsible for protecting the world ’ s wealth of species, the UN ’ s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geo-engineering. Its bleak conclusion, echoing that reached by many independent scientists, is that the chances are “highly uncertain”. “Novel means”, in this context, describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, and altering the amount of heat from the Sun that reaches the Earth. Some scientists and policymakers say geo-engineering, as these strategies are collectively known, is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement . This is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2°C above their pre-industrial levels, the Agreement’s basic goal. But the CBD says in a report that geo-engineering, while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating, might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects. Many independent analysts have raised similar concerns.Attempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans, in order to remove GHGs, have so far shown disappointing results. One report doubted that geo-engineering could slow sea-level rise . Another said it could not arrest the melting of Arctic ice . A third study found that geo-engineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse . Transboundary impacts The lead author of the CBD geo-engineering report is a British scientist, Dr Phillip Williamson, of the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council . He is an associate fellow in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia , UK. The CBD originally became involved in climate geo-engineering in 2008, because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment (they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters). The CBD’s concern expanded to include other geo-engineering techniques, especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts. Some scientists argue that “geo-engineering” is a hazily-defined term and prefer to speak instead simply of “greenhouse gas removal”. Dr Williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geo-engineering on biodiversity “is not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties”. On greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier ‘overshoot’ of emissions. New risks In some cases, they say, the cure may be worse than the disease: “The large-scale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change.” When it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation, a familiar theme recurs: “There are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of SRM [solar radiation management] techniques, which could present significant new risks to biodiversity.” Time and again, it seems, a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse: if SRM benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperature-induced bleaching (as it may), in certain conditions “it may also increase, indirectly, the impacts of ocean acidification.” There could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the Earth’s protective ozone layer. Dr Williamson and his colleagues believe that geo-engineering is essential—if it can be made to work—because of the diminishing chances that anything else will. “I’m sceptical. That’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible” They write: “It may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2°C limit by emission reduction alone. However, any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing.” Repeatedly, those two words recur: a suggested technique or development will be “highly uncertain”. Most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research, coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geo-engineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation. Dr Williamson told the Climate News Network: “I’m sceptical. That’s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible (for all sorts of reasons)” at the scale needed. When the CBD member governments meet in December they are expected to call for more research: a safe option in most circumstances, but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology once seen as very promising.

1475.0,3 Questions Ahead Of Tonight's Democratic Debate,"Sunday night's Democratic debate comes at a crucial moment. The two front-runners — Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders — are closer in the polls than ever, and the Iowa caucus is only two weeks away.

Up until now, Clinton has done well in debates; it's a format that suits her. But Sanders' message is breaking through, and he's gaining in the polls nationally, leads in New Hampshire and is neck and neck with Clinton in Iowa. That means the pressure is on for both candidates Sunday night. The debate, taking place in Charleston, S.C., begins at 9 p.m. EST. The NBC/YouTube/Congressional Black Caucus Institute debate will air on NBC broadcast stations and livestreamed on NBC digital platforms, including its YouTube channel.

Here's what the candidates need to do — and avoid:

Needs: Show why her plans are pragmatic solutions that work for the progressive base, while still respecting Sanders supporters. She's gotten away from her answer in the first debate that she's ""a progressive who likes to get things done."" Then again, it's tough to make that argument to primary voters

Avoid: Lawyerly, unclear answers that play into an inauthentic narrative, especially paired against Sanders, whose authenticity has been key; attacks that could be seen as cheap shots, like on health care

Needs: Convince Democratic voters, who are skeptical he's presidential material, that he can win; show a facility with issues beyond his core message

Avoid: Pulling punches like he's done in past debates

Needs: Somehow appear relevant; as it is, he barely made it onto the debate stage. His poll numbers had to be rounded up to qualify

Avoid: Being dismissed, especially after the question on the investigation into his discounted purchase of furniture from the governor's office when he left.

1. Where does the race stand? Hillary Clinton seemed to have a comfortable lead on Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders last year, but that has slipped considerably and they are in a neck-and-neck race.

Sanders has picked up momentum with his message and his passion — and Democratic voters like him. He continues to lead in New Hampshire, where he's been in the top spot for the better part of the last five months. He's also closing in Iowa, which is perhaps more surprising, but that's a place where passion counts, because of how the caucuses are conducted.

Beyond the first two states, Clinton still has leads with non-white voters, who are critical to Clinton's ""firewall"" in the South. But that firewall might not look as insurmountable if she loses one or both of these first crucial contests.

2. What about the issues — what's dividing these two? Sanders has gained steam because of his clear message on Wall Street and income inequality. He's tried to tie Clinton to big financial institutions, and Clinton has struggled in defending those ties, as Sanders has labeled her the ""status quo.""

Lately, it's been health care and guns. Sanders voted for Obamacare, but he prefers a single-payer system; Clinton wants more modest tweaks. It may have been a bad tactic for Clinton's daughter Chelsea to try and go after Sanders from the left and accuse him of wanting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Clinton stood by her daughter. Bigger picture: Clinton has criticized Sanders for how to pay all of the reforms he wants. Sanders has not been completely forthcoming on a financial and tax plan, though he promises to explain later.

Clinton has harped on Sanders' past support for more moderate gun measures, including his support for a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from liability if a gun made by one of them is used in a killing. On Saturday, the day before the debate, Sanders came out in favor of a measure to amend the law.

3. So, with these dividing lines, do they go negative in the debate? There's a risk in going negative, but more so for Clinton. Sanders' voters are very loyal. Clinton is losing ground and can't afford to be completely positive. But how to attack Sanders in a way that resonates and seems authentic will be a challenge. Clinton's making the case she's the more electable — and certainly most Democratic voters would do anything to make sure a Republican isn't elected, especially Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.",REAL,sunday

2232.0,Obama's terror strategy is failing: US must heed lessons of 9/11,"It is increasingly apparent that the U.S. war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team.

President Obama failed to even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address. In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse of what the future of terrorism looks like, and what the civilized world will have to defend against.

At the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S. partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a country that four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).



 

 ISIL and AQAP are two faces of the same enemy, radical violent Islam, which is on the march around the world.

In 2013, ISIL was confined to Syria and Iraq. As the Syria civil war dragged on, and in the absence of early, forceful intervention on the part of the United States or European nations, the chaotic situation spread to Iraq, where weak security services were no match for an emboldened terrorist army.

In 2014, global support to the Islamic State blossomed as it began to supplant likeminded terrorist groups, and the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia.  ISIL even has begun to make inroads in Yemen, where the United States has been involved in efforts to degrade AQAP's capabilities, but have been unable to eliminate AQAP's ability to conduct attacks on us and our allies.  AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threats America currently faces as the recent attacks in Paris show.

 

 In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror. But without a change in our strategy, the task of defending against the triple threat of home grown extremism, jihadists who have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria, and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible.

 

 The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia, using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languages to spread their message around the world.  They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and try to portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a means to attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate.

The United States and all civilized countries need to coordinate our efforts to fight the Islamic State first by cutting them off.  We must counter their message on social media; bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan; and ensure that we prevent suspected terrorists from traveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen.  Perhaps most importantly, we have to help governments eliminate the safe havens that the Islamic State relies on to gather strength.  

 

 Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failure to learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists who will eventually turn their attention toward us.

 

 We also cannot afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks.

The U.S. government should implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities so that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communications as we face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more than what they see on the Internet.

This year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe.

 

 The challenge we face as free societies is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades.  As we look at this moment in the long war against terrorism, it is encouraging to see Europeans aggressively moving to defend the continent following a horrific attack.  But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraq to see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy.  

 

 Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups.  They also do not keep Americans safe in the long term.  The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing and without greater leadership from the United States, I fear that it will only be a matter of time before innocent Americans pay the ultimate price if we continue to underestimate our enemies and not develop a strategy that is commensurate to the threat.

6247.0,“Bernie needs to be ground to a pulp.” Leaked Email to John Podesta in February,"Koch Brothers Secretly Allied w. George Soros for Hillary Clinton → Jay Kurtz 
Why would Bernie supporters vote Clinton? Because if she wins, his movement will be finished, and she will see to it that it is. 
On the other hand, if Trump wins, Hillary is finished, and Bernie will become the driving force in the Democratic Party, and will crush Trump in 2020. 
I just don’t understand why ANY Bernie supporter would be DUMB ENOUGH to vote for Hillary. gmatch 
There are many reasons not to vote for Hillary. Bernie is a proven fraud and should go away. If Trump wins – the DNC will have to change or it will not survive. kimyo 
while we’re talking about podesta emails, what is your interpretation of the following email from podesta re: a 2015 cnbc interview in which sanders stated “When you hustle money like that, you don’t sit in restaurants like this” and “That type of wealth has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.” 
podesta: This isn’t in keeping w the agreement. Since we clearly have some leverage, would be good to flag this for him. I could send a signal via Welch–or did you establish a direct line w him? 
my interpretation: you fell for sanders’ schtick like an egg from a tall chicken. he was never for real. you’ve been reporting on wrestlemania 2016 without comprehending that the whole thing is staged.

127.0,Selma 50 years on: John Lewis's recalls the march,"Watch live coverage of ceremonies in Selma commemorating 50 years since ""Bloody Sunday"" starting at 11 a.m. ET Saturday on CNN and CNNgo

(CNN) Fifty years ago this weekend, a 25-year-old John Lewis was beaten so badly by Alabama state troopers that they fractured his skull.

Lewis calls the Edmund Pettus Bridge -- where the troopers and and a group of white men deputized into a posse by the sheriff attacked hundreds of peaceful protesters on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965 -- an ""almost holy place.""

Now a Democratic U.S. congressman, Lewis is returning to Selma -- as he has nearly every year since that historic march -- to remember the fight for voting rights and to push voters across the country to participate in the political process. He also wants people to continue to speak up about the problems of racial injustice and poverty that persist in American society.

""It is important to come back to remember Selma,"" Lewis told CNN in an interview at First Baptist Church. ""The vote is powerful. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society and I don't want people to forget that people paid a price.

""Selma, these churches and these people, gave it everything they had. We wouldn't be where we are today as a nation and as a people (if it) hadn't been for this community.""

Churches -- like Selma's First Baptist and Brown Chapel -- served as important meeting places during the movement, in part because they were run by the black community.

And music was vital as a unifying force.

""Without music, the movement would have been like a bird without wings,"" Lewis said.

He recalled how people would often sing during the marches, sometimes making up songs along the way.

""Music helped create a sense of solidarity, and there were people in some communities, in some towns and cities like Selma, saying if the meetings are being held at the church, it must be all right. That's the house of the Lord. They must be doing something that is right.""

Activists had been working for years in and around Selma trying to help people register to vote. At the time, only 2.1% of blacks in Dallas County were registered, Lewis said. When blacks attempted to register, they were often given impossible tasks, like counting the number of jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap, to complete before being allowed to sign up. Black lawyers, doctors, business people, public school teachers and college professors were told they could not read and write well enough to pass the so-called literacy test.

As chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Lewis -- along with many others -- would spill blood to change that, not only as a leader of the Bloody Sunday march but in other confrontations across the South.

Lewis was arrested some 40 times during the 1960s as he challenged the segregationist Jim Crow laws that kept blacks oppressed. He spent 44 days imprisoned in Mississippi during the Freedom Rides in 1961. As a student at Fisk University, he organized sit-ins at lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee, even spending his birthday in jail there in 1961 -- so Lewis was no stranger to run-ins with the law. But the events of Bloody Sunday would prove fateful for the movement.

Television cameras and photographers captured the troopers attacking the marchers with night sticks and whips -- one man in the posse even had a rubber hose wrapped with barbed wire, Lewis wrote in his memoir ""Walking with the Wind.""

The troopers trampled the crowd with their horses and released nauseating tear gas. The pictures horrified citizens across the country. Eight days after the march, President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke before Congress about voting rights. He signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6 to ensure that all citizens would be able to vote regardless of their skin color.

Five decades later, Lewis said a great deal of progress has been made in the struggle for equality. But he added that, despite having twice elected a black man to the nation's highest office, the country still has a long way to go to become the so-called ""Beloved Community"" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned ""where we can lay down the burden of race.""

""We have a black president. We've made a lot of progress, but we're not a post-racial society yet,"" he said. ""We still have a distance to go. The scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American society.""

The need for 'righteous indignation'

Lewis, who has written a trilogy of graphic novels for young adults about his life called ""March,"" said it was important not to sweep the problems that still plague America under the rug and to instead speak up with a sense of ""righteous indignation.""

""You cannot be quiet. You have to speak up. You have to speak out. You have to find a way to get in the way and make some noise,"" he said, referring in particular to the killings of unarmed black men by police last summer in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.

He urged those demonstrating against police brutality and racial injustice to study and model the nonviolent methods of the civil rights activists of the 1950s and '60s.

The poverty affecting people of all races across the country still gnaws at Lewis, as does a lack of access to a good education. He believes people should be outraged about hunger and violence, and fired up to renew and strengthen the Voting Rights Act after a 2013 Supreme Court ruling gutted the key provision requiring certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to ""pre-clear"" any changes to voting laws with the federal government before implementing them.

On Saturday, Lewis and nearly 100 members of Congress from both parties will join President Barack Obama at the bridge in Selma -- a bridge that still bears the name of a Confederate general who was also a Ku Klux Klan leader -- to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. The bipartisan event comes as efforts to update to the Voting Rights Act have stalled in Congress. Still, Lewis is optimistic both parties can come together to fix it.

""We must do it. It's the right thing to do,"" he said. ""There is a deliberate, systematic effort to take us back. We've made too much progress to go back."" He was referring to efforts in some states to do away with early voting and voting on Sunday or on weekends and to require photo IDs, moves he said make it harder for young people, seniors and minorities to vote.

""I'm afraid that if we fail to fix it, many of our fellow citizens will not be able to become participants in the democratic process,"" he concluded.",REAL,watch live coverage of ceremonies in selma

6025.0,“We Were Long Overdue A Presidential Assassination Anyway”,"We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] “We Were Long Overdue A Presidential Assassination Anyway” November 9, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS Share 0 Add Comment 
AMERICANS still coming to terms with the surprising outcome of the 2016 US elections have sought solace in the fact that the country was long overdue a presidential assassination anyway. 
“It’s been what, 50 odd years since the last one?” queried disgruntled Florida native Toby Hartford, “I mean Reagan doesn’t count since he survived it”. 
Citing the perfect societal conditions for a swell in dissatisfaction and disquiet brought on by divisive rhetoric, isolation and amplified fears to fester, much of the American population was in agreement that ‘yes, an assassination is something that could conceivably happen’. 
“I wouldn’t not celebrate it, were it to happen, which is really fucking depressing when I think about it. I thought I was a decent human being, and this was a decent country, but fuck it, this is where we’re at now,” shared New Yorker Bernice Stewart. 
“I’m not saying it’s something I want, I abhor murder, but give it a few months and when Trump hasn’t made America great again by placing US Muslims in internment camps, I’ve every faith in him stirring the sorts of emotions in a mentally unstable individual required to break our 53-year streak,” another voter remarked. 
Experts in slowly unraveling individuals with access to guns even speculated that the ultimate cause of the assassination may be seemingly insignificant. 
“Right now, no one is focused enough to remember Trump said he would release his tax returns, but when he delays that disclosure again and again, someone who never really gave a shit about that might start studying a map of tall buildings surrounding his victory parade route in New York. It could be one of those very people Trump mobilised to vote; working class, jobless and perennially ignored by the political establishment that will pull the trigger, ironic really,” isolated loner expert Condie Matthews explained.

Those playing along at home probably noticed that the flood of groping and sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, whether true or false, receded awfully quickly once the media and the Clinton campaign decided to clear the decks for a new batch of think pieces about Trump’s allegations that the election was rigged. 
In case the public missed the hint that, by questioning the integrity of America’s electoral process, Trump was sowing the seeds of Election Day violence, a new wave of think pieces emerged to make the threat that much more explicit. They’re not saying there’s gonna be violence; they’re just strongly implying there’s gonna be violence. If there is unrest and violence after election day, I think we now know why. https://t.co/P6WNdG36f5

4979.0,Third-party presidential candidates fight for 15% in polls – and a spot in debates,"The former Republican, marijuana-smoking, Everest mountaineering ex-governor of New Mexico and presidential nominee of the Libertarian party has a problem: he’s barred from the presidential debates. To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn, Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15% from around 8% now.

Without that national exposure, and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, it’s hard for anyone to see how Johnson, 63, or either of two other minor-party candidates, the Green party’s Jill Stein or even Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old former CIA counterterrorism officer, could ever become more than mere electoral curiosities.

But the emergence of three independent candidates, during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases.

Soft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, “the craziest election of all time”, he had a chance: “I might be the next president of the United States.”

A just-released WSJ-NBC poll gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted.

“A wasted vote is voting for somebody you don’t believe in. That’s a wasted vote,” Johnson said. “Vote for the person you believe in – that’s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you’ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.”

Stein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as “the most disliked and untrusted” major-party nominees in US history. 

“Democracy needs a moral compass,” she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. “It’s not just about who you don’t like the most or who you are most afraid of.” 



Stein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a “Green New Deal”, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.



On the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded “Never Trump” movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he’d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into “people’s darkest prejudices and deepest fears”.

McMullin’s best hope – and likely his only one – to make an electoral dent would require Trump’s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. “Like millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,” McMullin said in his announcement.

“Instead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.”

But can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took 18% of the vote, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate won a paltry 2.74% of the vote, and his supporters were split between Republicans and Democrats.

Johnson’s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he’d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump’s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.

But that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited.

“At the moment it doesn’t look like they can have much impact at all,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. “But if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.”

Sheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.

Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.

“Some of our production people may have said, ‘Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,’’ McCurry told Politico. “We won’t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.”

Ron Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. “Polls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,” he said, “and in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.”

But even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.

“The biggest message is ‘consider us’ as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they’re not able to do anything,” Johnson has said.

Stein advanced a similar argument. “We’re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,” she said, “and the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.”

She argued that it was by elections about “the lesser of two evils” that the country inherited many of its problems.

But first, the two have to get on TV.

“There’s no way I’m going to win the presidency if I’m not in the presidential debates,” Johnson said. “I do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.”",REAL,the former republican marijuanasmoking everest mountaineering exgovernor of new mexico and presidential nominee of the libertarian party has a

1700.0,"Bush, Rubio and Kasich eye one another in the shadow of Trump","The Republican presidential contest is not, regardless of what it seems some days, all about Donald Trump. There’s another dynamic unfolding that has almost nothing to do with the businessman-politician currently atop the polls but that will have a major influence on who becomes the party’s nominee.

This other struggle involves the competition among former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. History suggests that whoever emerges triumphant in this three-way rivalry will be in a strong position to claim the nomination, though admittedly the past has been a poor predictor of events so far in this campaign.

Ever since Trump surged to the top of the polls, the other candidates have been trying to assess both his staying power and the cost-benefit analysis of engaging him. Trump and Bush have clashed almost from the start, with growing intensity. More recently, as Rubio has risen, Trump has taken aim at him, and Rubio has responded in kind.

None of the other candidates has a clear strategy for taking down Trump. But they all think he will look like a different candidate — and in their assessments, a less formidable candidate — once the field narrows to three or four finalists after the voting begins. So they are beginning to focus on one another as much as they are worrying about him.

With the first contests still months away, none of the three yet looks like a front-runner. In the average of recent national polls, Rubio and Bush run fourth and fifth behind Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina. Neither Bush nor Rubio breaks double digits. Kasich doesn’t even break 5 percent.

National polls at this stage are less meaningful than state polls. In Iowa, where the first caucus will take place in early February, Trump and Carson lead, with Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) currently third. Bush and Rubio trail the first three, and Kasich is even deeper in the pack. In New Hampshire, Trump also has a big lead, but Kasich is jockeying with Fiorina for second, with Carson and Bush next and Rubio farther back.

[Trump and Bush take on Rubio in New Hampshire]

In recent days, Bush, Rubio and Kasich have shown how much they’re worrying about one another. They’ve been sniping at each other and making other moves that underscore the significance of their competition.

Rubio has long emphasized that the party needs a fresh candidate, not one tied to the past, an implicit criticism of his fellow Floridian who is part of an American political dynasty. Bush, a two-term former governor, has belittled Rubio’s experience, or lack thereof. Kasich, a two-term governor and longtime House member, has claimed that his experience and record are unmatched by any of the other candidates.

Advisers to the three anticipate more attacks ahead. “The Bush campaign is feverishly doing their opposition research on Governor Kasich and Senator Rubio,” said John Weaver, Kasich’s chief strategist. “An empire like that is not going to go quietly into the night. We’re expecting pretty sharp elbows to be thrown. We’re going to handle it head on.”

Past Republican nomination contests often have devolved into competition between a candidate from the center-right or mainstream conservative wing of the party and a candidate from the hard right or populist conservative wing. Most times, the candidate from the mainstream conservative wing becomes the nominee.

This year, the race is more scrambled because of the added factor of the apparent desire by many Republicans for an outsider or non-politician. That has elevated Trump, Carson and Fiorina and has forced the others to adapt. Rubio has been stressing that, despite being in the Senate, he’s really not of Washington.

Instead of establishment vs. tea party, one GOP strategist describes the race this time as a competition between those in the anger, or anti-Washington, lane, vs. those in the aspirational lane. Bush, Rubio and Kasich all fall more into the aspirational lane.

What will make the difference? Based on how the three candidates are running, it’s clear that they see the path ahead in slightly different ways, though each has handicaps he must overcome to win.

Bush has repeatedly pushed back at Trump by arguing that anger and insults cannot win the presidency. He seeks to be the aspirational candidate, conservative enough because of his record in Florida to be acceptable to a conservative party, while offering a positive and inclusive message that reaches beyond the GOP coalition.

But many Republicans see Bush as least able to appeal across the entire party — not much more able to appeal to the hard right than Cruz would be able to attract mainstream conservatives.

Lodged firmly in the establishment wing as the son and brother of former presidents, he faces resistance on the far right and among those yearning for an outsider. His hope is that he can change perceptions of himself, outlast his rivals with superior resources and persuade Republicans that he’s their best hope to win a general election.

Sally Bradshaw, Bush’s senior adviser, said the key remains what it has been from the start of the campaign: to portray Bush as a conservative reformer by stressing what he did in Florida. “People don’t know that yet,” she said. “When that message burns in, his numbers are going to change. That’s his path.”

[What the pundits said then and now about Donald Trump]

Kasich is looking to the traditional model. He is the compassionate conservative of 2016 who hopes to strike first in New Hampshire and build from there. His advisers believe that, eventually, he can reach across the divide in the party to become the nominee.

But the party has not only moved right in the past decade, it also has developed a harder edge than when George W. Bush ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000. Kasich’s support for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is just one example of a position that will not sit well with many conservatives.

Rubio’s team sees crosscutting appeal as vital, a race that will favor a candidate who can best unite a fractured party. The senator’s goal is to demonstrate skills as a communicator, to show depth on the issues, to turn his personal story into a positive message for the party, to make as few errors as possible and over time generate enthusiasm across the GOP coalition.

Rubio, too, has vulnerabilities. His past support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, from which he has backed away, remains an obstacle in his path. So too does his personal profile, that of a youthful first-term senator with limited experience trying to become president — a profile not unlike that of President Obama when he first ran eight years ago.

David Axelrod, who was Obama’s chief strategist in both campaigns, often has said that voters look for a replacement rather than a replica in picking a new president. The adviser to one of Rubio’s rivals put it this way: “When was the last time this country elected two presidents with similar attributes?” Rubio will be trying to dissuade his fellow Republicans that he isn’t another Obama.

There are wild cards in the calculations of all three camps. Maybe New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who occupies similar space, will catch fire in New Hampshire and elsewhere, although the resistance to him within the party is significant. Fiorina has demonstrated fearlessness that has jarred even Trump and can appeal across the party. Carson remains a candidate of unknown potential.

Last, there is the Trump factor and what his support represents. For now, he remains the dominant force in the GOP race. But the advisers to Bush, Rubio and Kasich see a turn in the campaign heading into the final months of the year, one that will heighten the competition among them with significant consequences for their party.",REAL,the republican presidential contest is not regardless of what it seems some days all about donald trump theres another dynamic unfolding that has almost nothing to do with the businessmanpolitician currently atop the polls but that will have a major influence on who becomes the partys nominee this other struggle involves the competition among former florida governor jeb bush sen marco rubio fla and ohio gov john kasich history suggests that whoever emerges triumphant in this threeway rivalry will be in a strong position to claim the nomination though admittedly the past has been a poor predictor of events so far in this campaign ever since trump surged to the top of the polls the other candidates have been trying to assess both his staying power and the costbenefit analysis of engaging him trump and bush have clashed almost from the start with growing intensity more recently as rubio has risen trump has taken aim at him and rubio has responded in kind none of the other candidates has a clear strategy for taking down trump but they all think he will look like a different candidate  and in their assessments a less formidable candidate  once the field narrows to three or four finalists after the voting begins so they are beginning to focus on one another as much as they are worrying about him with the first contests still months away none of the three yet looks like a frontrunner in the average of recent national polls rubio and bush run fourth and fifth behind trump retired neurosurgeon ben carson and former hewlettpackard chief executive carly fiorina neither bush nor rubio breaks double digits kasich doesnt even break  percent national polls at this stage are less meaningful than state polls in iowa where the first caucus will take place in early february trump and carson lead with sen ted cruz tex currently third bush and rubio trail the first three and kasich is even deeper in the pack in new hampshire trump also has a big lead but kasich is jockeying with fiorina for second with carson and bush next and rubio farther back trump and bush take on rubio in new hampshire in recent days bush rubio and kasich have shown how much theyre worrying about one another theyve been sniping at each other and making other moves that underscore the significance of their competition rubio has long emphasized that the party needs a fresh candidate not one tied to the past an implicit criticism of his fellow floridian who is part of an american political dynasty bush a twoterm former governor has belittled rubios experience or lack thereof kasich a twoterm governor and longtime house member has claimed that his experience and record are unmatched by any of the other candidates advisers to the three anticipate more attacks ahead the bush campaign is feverishly doing their opposition research on governor kasich and senator rubio said john weaver kasichs chief strategist an empire like that is not going to go quietly into the night were expecting pretty sharp elbows to be thrown were going to handle it head on past republican nomination contests often have devolved into competition between a candidate from the centerright or mainstream conservative wing of the party and a candidate from the hard right or populist conservative wing most times the candidate from the mainstream conservative wing becomes the nominee this year the race is more scrambled because of the added factor of the apparent desire by many republicans for an outsider or nonpolitician that has elevated trump carson and fiorina and has forced the others to adapt rubio has been stressing that despite being in the senate hes really not of washington instead of establishment vs tea party one gop strategist describes the race this time as a competition between those in the anger or antiwashington lane vs those in the aspirational lane bush rubio and kasich all fall more into the aspirational lane what will make the difference based on how the three candidates are running its clear that they see the path ahead in slightly different ways though each has handicaps he must overcome to win bush has repeatedly pushed back at trump by arguing that anger and insults cannot win the presidency he seeks to be the aspirational candidate conservative enough because of his record in florida to be acceptable to a conservative party while offering a positive and inclusive message that reaches beyond the gop coalition but many republicans see bush as least able to appeal across the entire party  not much more able to appeal to the hard right than cruz would be able to attract mainstream conservatives lodged firmly in the establishment wing as the son and brother of former presidents he faces resistance on the far right and among those yearning for an outsider his hope is that he can change perceptions of himself outlast his rivals with superior resources and persuade republicans that hes their best hope to win a general election sally bradshaw bushs senior adviser said the key remains what it has been from the start of the campaign to portray bush as a conservative reformer by stressing what he did in florida people dont know that yet she said when that message burns in his numbers are going to change thats his path what the pundits said then and now about donald trump kasich is looking to the traditional model he is the compassionate conservative of  who hopes to strike first in new hampshire and build from there his advisers believe that eventually he can reach across the divide in the party to become the nominee but the party has not only moved right in the past decade it also has developed a harder edge than when george w bush ran as a compassionate conservative in  kasichs support for expanding medicaid under the affordable care act is just one example of a position that will not sit well with many conservatives rubios team sees crosscutting appeal as vital a race that will favor a candidate who can best unite a fractured party the senators goal is to demonstrate skills as a communicator to show depth on the issues to turn his personal story into a positive message for the party to make as few errors as possible and over time generate enthusiasm across the gop coalition rubio too has vulnerabilities his past support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants from which he has backed away remains an obstacle in his path so too does his personal profile that of a youthful firstterm senator with limited experience trying to become president  a profile not unlike that of president obama when he first ran eight years ago david axelrod who was obamas chief strategist in both campaigns often has said that voters look for a replacement rather than a replica in picking a new president the adviser to one of rubios rivals put it this way when was the last time this country elected two presidents with similar attributes rubio will be trying to dissuade his

9398.0,Comey Must Explain Why He Advised Obama Not to Publicly Accuse Russia of Hacking Democrats,"By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1:26 pm Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as ""partisan"". Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Russia did hack the Democrats. So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. 
But FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as “partisan”. 
Republican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more “on the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,” officials “familiar with the deliberations” told the Washington Post. 
These sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. 
There are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency’s investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton’s emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. 
Comey’s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already “compromised.” 
Only one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. 
The same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. 
Not sure I’m buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn’t have said anything at all, but that doesn’t mean that his motives were nefarious. 
There might well be good reason for this – after all, this is the FBI and they can’t tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn’t mean he isn’t doing his job properly. 
But Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now. He is under fire for good reason, as the explanations he’s giving for these decisions don’t make sense and are contradictory.",FAKE,by sarah jones on tue nov st  at  pm comey struggled with not

10427.0,"Putin Congratulates Trump, Says Russia Is Ready To Restore Relations With The US","1 Reply 
Tyler Durden – Perhaps the most beneficial outcome resulting from last night’s loss of the Clinton Clan, whose “charitable” donations from generous donors such as Saudi Arabia to the Clinton Foundation just ended, is that with Hillary not in charge, the probability of World War III has been taken off the table. 
This was confirmed early this morning, When Russian President Vladimir Putin – whose relations with the US and Barack Obama have deteriorated to Cold War levels – congratulated Donald Trump for his election victory on Wednesday, and said he expected relations between the Kremlin and Washington to improve. 
The Kremlin announced that Putin had sent a telegram to Trump on Wednesday morning expressing “ his hope they can work together toward the end of the crisis in Russian-American relations, as well address the pressing issues of the international agenda and the search for effective responses to global security challenges .” 
Additionally, speaking at the presentation ceremony of foreign ambassadors’ letters of credentials in Moscow, President Putin said that Russia is ready and looks forward to restoring bilateral relations with the United States, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, commenting on the news of Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. 
“We heard Trump’s campaign rhetoric while still a candidate for the US presidency, which was focused on restoring the relations between Russia and the United States.” 
He added that “we understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path in the light of the degradation in which, unfortunately, the relationship between Russia and the US are at the moment.” 
Speaking about the degraded state of relations between the countries, the Russian president once again stressed that “it is not our fault that Russia-US relations are as you see them.” 
Other Russian politicians joined in. 
Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has also expressed hope that Trump’s victory in the presidential election will help pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington. 
“The current US-Russian relations cannot be called friendly. Hopefully, with the new US president a more constructive dialogue will be possible between our countries,” he said. “The Russian Parliament will welcome and support any steps in this direction,” Volodin added on Wednesday. 
Commenting on Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russia will judge the new US administration by its actions and take appropriate steps in response. “We are ready to work with any US leader elected by the US people,” the minister said on Wednesday. 
“I can’t say that all the previous US leaders were always predictable. This is life, this is politics. I have heard many words but we will judge by actions.” 
Sergey Zheleznyak, member of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party in parliament, hailed Trump’s “deserved victory” in a statement on the party’s website. 
“Despite all the intrigues and provocations that the current U.S. government put in front of Trump, people supported his intention to address the serious problems that have accumulated in America, and to move from confrontation to cooperation with Russia and the world, ” Zheleznyak said. “I hope that between now and [his] entry into office as the new president of the United States there will be no tragic events and the new U.S. administration will have enough political will and wisdom for civilized solutions to existing problems.” 
Russia’s second biggest party the Communist Party also issued a statement Wednesday morning, expressing hope for more cooperation and calling Trump’s win “astounding” and against the “elite clans” in the United States. The party leader was more lukewarm on the news, noting that U.S. imperialism was unlikely to change. 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the right-wing nationalist leader of the Liberal Democratic Party who has previously been nicknamed the Russian Donald Trump, called Clinton a “mindless old woman” and praised U.S. voters for “coming to their senses” after eight years of President Barack Obama, whom he referred to as “the Afro-American.” SF Source Zerohedge  ",FAKE, reply tyler durden  perhaps the most

7099.0,Monsieur Malbrough est Mort | New Eastern Outlook,"Region: Europe A recently published article titled with the words of a popular French song “ Marlbrough s’en va-t-en Guerre ” has attracted much attention around the background of Francois Hollande’s “achievements” Now that Donald Trump has been elected as the next President of the United States, a string of European politicians have started voicing their discontent, including the current French President. He has failed to hide such discontent with the decision Americans have made. However, he described Trump’s victory as a “lesson learnt,” the importance of which “goes far beyond the borders of the United States.” Little did he know, French politicians have interpreted this passage in their own reserved way. On November 10, the lower house of the Assemblée nationale has passed the vote to impeach Hollande, passing the bill with 152 votes out of the total of 199, resulting in the president of the Assemblée Nationale, Claude Bartolone, officially submitting a draft resolution for Hollande’s impeachment. The impeachment procedure has only been introduced in 2014 in accordance with Article 68 of the French Constitution. According to the laws of the Fifth Republic, a president can only be impeached if he blatantly ignored his duties. To start this procedure, one would have to obtain 58 votes in the Assemblée Nationale, where the Republicans are now holding a total of 193 seats. The demand for Hollande to leave was signed by a total 152 deputies, including the Republican Spokesperson in the Assembly, Christian Jacob and the former Prime-Minister Fran ç ois Fillon. The Right are convinced that Hollande should be held liable for disclosing state secrets in his book with the telling title “ A President Shouldn’t Say This “ (U n pr é sident ne devrait pas dire ç a …). They are convinced that a president should know better than putting down all the details of French secret service operations aimed at assassinating terrorist leaders abroad. If the draft is to be found valid, it will be handed over to a special judicial committee of the the lower house of the the Assemblée Nationale. Finally, when everything is said and done, the two houses will form the Republican High Court that will decide the fate of the sitting president. But regardless of how the impeachment procedure turns out in the end, this whole affairs has literally ended Hollande’s political career, since he has no chance to get reelected. Therefore, one could use the words of the above mentioned song : « Monsieur Malbrough est mort » ( Malbrough is now dead ). However, this wasn’t much of a surprise for anyone who has been following French politics, since, according to Le Figaro , Hollande’s approval rating has hit an all time low of 11%. No President in French history enjoyed less support from the population, with even the Socialist party reluctant to back up Hollande’s policies, with only 34% supporting him. However, it seems unlikely that Hollande will be the only European leader that will have to face the consequences of his mindless support of US President Obama’s warmongering policies that have, at the end of the day, inflicted serious damage to EU interests.

4500.0,Conspiracy theories swirl around the death of Antonin Scalia,"Two days after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in remote West Texas, a former D.C. homicide commander is raising questions about how the death was handled by local and federal authorities.

“As a former homicide commander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,” William O. Ritchie, former head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday.

[The death of Antonin Scalia: Chaos, confusion and conflicting reports]

Scalia was found dead in his room at a luxury hunting resort in the state’s Big Bend region by the resort’s owner. It took hours for authorities to find a justice of the peace. When they did, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body — which is permissible under Texas law — and without ordering an autopsy.

On Sunday, the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides security for Supreme Court justices, said that Scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch, so marshals were not present when he died. When the marshals were notified, deputy marshals from the Western District of Texas went to the scene, the service said in a statement.

Guevara said she declared Scalia dead based on information from law enforcement officials on the scene, who assured her that “there were no signs of foul play.” She also spoke to Scalia’s doctor, who told her that the justice had been to see him Wednesday and Thursday last week for a shoulder injury and that he had ordered an MRI for Scalia, according to WFAA-TV in Dallas. The 79-year-old justice also suffered from several chronic conditions, Guevara said. She said she was awaiting a statement from the physician to complete Scalia’s death certificate.

The manager of the El Paso funeral home that handled Scalia’s body said Scalia’s family insisted on not having an autopsy done. But the decision has spawned a host of conspiracy theories online, as well as skeptical questions from law enforcement experts such as Ritchie.

“You have a Supreme Court Justice who died, not in attendance of a physician,” he wrote. “You have a non-homicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed. You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack. What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction? Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?”

In an interview with The Washington Post, Guevara has said she rebutted a report by a Dallas TV station that Scalia had died of “myocardial infarction.” She said she meant only that his heart had stopped.

Ritchie also raised questions about the marshals’ actions:

“How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack…” “Did the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.”

A spokesman for the marshals service said Monday that the marshals did not make a formal determination of death. He directed questions to the county judge who made the call.

Scalia’s physician, Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalia’s health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland.

“Patient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,” he said.

When asked whether he planned to make public the statement he’s preparing for Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter.

8013.0,"What is one more election thread, ehhh?","a reply to: kruphix Theocracy? Tim Kaine? In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. “Some of the people were wondering what’s going on, who is this guy?” Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why. His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story “It was a time of such intrigue and suspicion,” Mr. Kaine said. Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to “Lord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread.” Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.",FAKE,a reply to kruphix theocracy tim kaine in september  as violence and civil war erupted throughout central america a quiet american left harvard law school to volunteer with jesuit missionaries in northern honduras around him the united statesbacked military dictatorship hunted marxists and cracked down on the catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers but some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mophaired midwesterner in their midst just a few hours south the central intelligence agency was using honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against latin american communism with rightwing forces training for operations in el salvador and nicaragua some of the people were wondering whats going on who is this guy tim kaine then a yearold volunteer and now the democratic nominee for vice president said in an interview he understood why his mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly american faces continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it was a time of such intrigue and suspicion mr kaine said far from being a cia operative mr kaine was a young catholic at a crossroads undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in honduras in its farflung pueblos banana plantation company towns and dusty cities mr kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel known as liberation theology that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden in honduras his recitation of the traditional catholic mealtime blessing changed to lord give bread to those who hunger and hunger for justice to those who have bread honduran military leaders american officials and even pope john paul ii viewed liberation theology suspiciously as dangerously injecting marxist beliefs into religious teaching but the strong socialjustice message of liberation theology helped set mr kaine on a leftveering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination became a liberal mayor and rose as a spanishspeaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on latin america,"['reply', 'kruphix', 'theocracy', 'tim', 'kaine', 'september', 'violence', 'civil', 'war', 'erupted', 'throughout', 'central', 'america', 'quiet', 'american', 'left', 'harvard', 'law', 'school', 'volunteer', 'jesuit', 'missionaries', 'northern', 'honduras', 'around', 'united', 'statesbacked', 'military', 'dictatorship', 'hunted', 'marxists', 'cracked', 'catholic', 'clergy', 'preaching', 'empowerment', 'peasant', 'farmers', 'locals', 'also', 'looked', 'warily', 'bearded', 'mophaired', 'midwesterner', 'midst', 'hours', 'south', 'central', 'intelligence', 'agency', 'using', 'honduras', 'staging', 'ground', 'covert', 'war', 'latin', 'american', 'communism', 'rightwing', 'forces', 'training', 'operations', 'el', 'salvador', 'nicaragua', 'people', 'wondering', 'whats', 'going', 'guy', 'tim', 'kaine', 'yearold', 'volunteer', 'democratic', 'nominee', 'vice', 'president', 'said', 'interview', 'understood', 'mentors', 'priesthood', 'also', 'urged', 'wary', 'friendly', 'american', 'faces', 'continue', 'reading', 'main', 'story', 'advertisement', 'continue', 'reading', 'main', 'story', 'time', 'intrigue', 'suspicion', 'mr', 'kaine', 'said', 'far', 'cia', 'operative', 'mr', 'kaine', 'young', 'catholic', 'crossroads', 'undergoing', 'spiritual', 'shift', 'awakened', 'plight', 'deeply', 'poor', 'honduras', 'farflung', 'pueblos', 'banana', 'plantation', 'company', 'towns', 'dusty', 'cities', 'mr', 'kaine', 'embraced', 'interpretation', 'gospel', 'known', 'liberation', 'theology', 'championed', 'social', 'change', 'improve', 'lives', 'downtrodden', 'honduras', 'recitation', 'traditional', 'catholic', 'mealtime', 'blessing', 'changed', 'lord', 'give', 'bread', 'hunger', 'hunger', 'justice', 'bread', 'honduran', 'military', 'leaders', 'american', 'officials', 'even', 'pope', 'john', 'paul', 'ii', 'viewed', 'liberation', 'theology', 'suspiciously', 'dangerously', 'injecting', 'marxist', 'beliefs', 'religious', 'teaching', 'strong', 'socialjustice', 'message', 'liberation', 'theology', 'helped', 'set', 'mr', 'kaine', 'leftveering', 'career', 'path', 'fought', 'lawyer', 'housing', 'discrimination', 'became', 'liberal', 'mayor', 'rose', 'spanishspeaking', 'governor', 'senator', 'enduring', 'focus', 'latin', 'america']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'TIME', 'NORP', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'LOC']","{'NORP': 9, 'PERSON': 7, 'GPE': 3, 'ORG': 2, 'DATE': 1, 'TIME': 1, 'LOC': 1}",2,7,3,340,-0.03064236111111111,86

McCain was pushing back against Trump's assertion last week that the United States should let ISIS and Syria's army fight -- and let Russia worry about ISIS there. Trump's comment came as Russia launched air strikes in the region.

""Do we want to keep slaughtering people in Syria that are fighting for freedom?"" McCain said. ""Do we want to continue the barrel bombing, which is one of the reasons why 240,000 Syrians have been murdered? Do we want this flood of refugees to continue?""

In the interview, McCain also prodded Republican presidential candidates to ""think about Ronald Reagan and the way he conducted his campaigns.""

""To impugn each other's characters and integrity is very harmful to each other, ourselves, and our chances of winning a general election,"" he said, without naming any specific candidates. ""I think there's a lot of people in the party that are not happy about the tenor of some of the remarks and the allegations about each other,"" McCain said.

4943.0,Trump manager says 'undercover voters' will deliver win in US election,"The Donald Trump campaign is counting on “undercover voters” to win in November.

Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway outlined her vision of how the Republican nominee could win in November despite consistently trailing in polls, during an interview with Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win?

Conway insisted that Trump’s support was not reflected in polls because of the perceived social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee. “Donald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections … it’s become socially desirable, especially if you’re a college educated person in the US, to say that you’re against Donald Trump,” said Conway.

“People who are supporting Donald Trump, who have not voted Republican in the past, who have not voted in quite a while, are so tired of arguing with family and friends and colleagues about their support of Donald Trump that they just decided not to discuss it.”

Conway insisted: “We give people a comfortable way to express that maybe they don’t want to vote this year and why that is.” She described her method as “proprietary”. She said that as a result, she could reach these undercover voters “in many different ways”. She said: “We go to them where they live, literally.”

Conway’s statement echoes what in American politics is known as the Bradley effect, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters that they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth.

It is named for former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, who was favored in polls in California’s 1982 gubernatorial election over his white Republican opponent, George Deukmejian, before suffering a narrow shock loss on election day. However, while its existence is disputed, anecdotal evidence for the phenomenon is mostly concentrated in the 1980s and 1990s. Conway’s argument is that something fundamentally similar is happening in the US in 2016.

Speaking to Channel 4 earlier this month, Conway buoyed her claims by citing the UK’s experience of the EU referendum vote.

Polling suggested the UK would remain in the European Union, but it became clear on election night that the vote was going the other way.

Conway said: “Voices are silenced in polls that really should be included because people are too reliant on lists, and they’re excluding people who maybe feel so passionately about that issue, Brexit, or so passionately about this candidate, Donald Trump, that they’re going to vote for the first time ever in many, many, many cycles.”



In the past week, Trump has begun to ditch his previous unscripted style, using teleprompters on stage at every rally. That is despite repeatedly bashing the technology in the past, saying in August 2015: “I say we should outlaw teleprompters … for anybody running for president.”

The shift toward making Trump a more predictable candidate came as Conway took control of the campaign. The top aide outlined the message she thought Trump should continue to emphasize: “The best Donald Trump is the Donald Trump who is talking about national and homeland security, economic growth and prosperity, ethics and why so many Americans dislike and distrust Washington and all its adjuncts, its consultants, its donors, its lobbyists, its politicians, its way of doing business.”

However, despite his adoption of teleprompters, Trump still veered badly off script in a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night. The Republican nominee said: “You can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.”

He continued to claim that if he were elected, “we’ll get rid of the crime. You’ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.”

Just as there may be a cohort of undercover Trump voters waiting to emerge in November, it seems that despite Conway’s best efforts, there is an undercover candidate who won’t let a teleprompter keep his penchant for controversial statements hidden.",REAL,the donald trump campaign is counting on undercover voters to win in november trumps campaign manager kellyanne conway outlined her vision of

8122.0,Suspect captured in ‘ambush-style’ killings of two Iowa cops,"Suspect captured in ‘ambush-style’ killings of two Iowa cops 11/02/2016 
USA TODAY 
Authorities captured a 46-year-old male suspect without incident Wednesday, hours after an early-morning “ambush-style” killing of two police officers in the Des Moines metro area. 
The suspect in the back-to-back killings was identified as Scott Michael Greene, said Urbandale police spokesman Sgt. Chad Underwood. Before capturing him, police had described Greene, who was last seen driving a blue Ford F-150 with an Iowa license plate, as armed and dangerous. 
Greene was taken into custody by the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department while walking along a rural road in Redfield, about 35 miles west of where the shootings occurred. 
According to police, Greene flagged down a passing Department of Natural Resources officer, handed over his ID and told the officer to call police. No shots were fired and there was no struggle, according to police. 
The suspect was taken by ambulance to a Des Moines hospital with an unknown injury. 
In a late morning news conference, police identified the slain officers as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines police Sgt. Anthony “Tony” Beminio. 
The attacks began around 1:06 a.m. CT, when police departments from both cities responded to reports of gunfire at the intersection of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale. 
The first officers arriving on the scene found Martin fatally wounded. About 20 minutes later, some two miles away, Beminio was was shot near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Ave. while responding to reports of the first officer’s shooting. Beminio was transported to Iowa Methodist Medical Center, where he died. Scott Michael Greene (Photo: Des Moines Police) 
Both officers were gunned down in their patrol cars. 
“It doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is that shot them while they sat in their cars,” a visibly emotional Parizek told reporters. 
“In all appearances it looks … that these officers were ambushed,” he added. Officer from Des Moines and another from Urbandale were shot and killed in their cars, @dmpolice said. #officersdown 
— Daniel P. Finney (@newsmanone) November 2, 2016 
Des Moines police, fearing officers were being singled out, paired up its patrol officers so none were on the street alone, Parizek said. 
“There’s literally a clear and present danger if you’re a police officer,” he said. 
Police did not offer many details on how investigators identified Greene as a suspect. Underwood said he was identified “through a series of leads and a series of investigative tips.” 
As of an early-morning news conference, police were still notifying the family members of the slain officers and planned to withhold the officers’ names, years of service and other details until later in the day, Parizek said. 
Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the killings, saying “violence has no place in the United States of America.’’ 
“Let me be clear, there is no message in murder,’’ the attorney general said, referring to simmering distrust between law enforcement and many communities across the country. “Violence creates nothing; it only destroys.’’ A Des Moines police officer was found fatally shot in a vehicle near the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Avenue in Des Moines on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. (Photo: Brian Powers, The Des Moines Register) 
It’s the first time Des Moines has seen a police officer shot and killed in the line of duty since two officers were gunned down in separate incidents in 1977. 
Two Des Moines officers, Susan Farrell and Carlos Puente-Morales, died earlier this year when their vehicle was struck head-on by a wrong-way drunk driver. 
The killing of the Urbandale officer appeared to be the city’s first for an officer shot in the line of duty, Underwood said at the news conference. 
Parizek thanked the community for its support when the department lost Farrell and Puente-Morales, as well as with this tragedy. 
“I don’t even know where to begin on how bad this year is,” he said. But, “this is what we do.

In a statement, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad called the attack on the officers “an attack on the public safety of all Iowans.” 
“We call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice,” he said. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm’s way.” 
Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst extended her thoughts and prayers to the families of the officers killed. 
“Although the investigation is still unfolding, what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us,” Ernst said. “This was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated.”

8988.0,Re: 10 Things That Every American Should Know About Donald Trump’s Plan To Save The U.S. Economy,"Archives Michael On Television 10 Things That Every American Should Know About Donald Trump’s Plan To Save The U.S. Economy By Michael Snyder, on September 15th, 2016 
Can Donald Trump turn the U.S. economy around? This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America don’t have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour? 
If you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest “economic recovery” since the Great Depression… 
Last week’s GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. It’s the weakest recovery since the Great Depression – the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions. 
And Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been. 
So how would he fix things? 
The following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trump’s plan to save the U.S. economy… 
#1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class 
The tax savings under Trump’s plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article … 
• A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. 
• A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. 
• Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill. 
#2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses 
Under his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clinton’s plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trump’s plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return. 
But where would the lost tax revenue be made up? 
#3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation 
For working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with. 
It is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this? 
#4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment 
This would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit. 
#5 A temporary freeze on new regulations 
Red tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trump’s planned freeze on new regulations… 
In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to “nearly $15,000 per U.S. household” annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it. 
#6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated 
In particular, Trump’s plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website … The Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPA’s Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interior’s moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. 
#7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe 
Donald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following … Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations. 
#8 Donald Trump’s plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry 
Barack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following … Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton’s extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. 
#9 Trump would repeal Obamacare 
Trump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs . 
Not only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families. 
Trump says that he would “replace” Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement. 
What exactly would he replace it with? 
#10 Trump’s plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve 
This is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger. 
Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight. 
We are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this … 
America’s economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession. 
Workforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced. 
Median real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise. 
That same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time… 
If we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results. 
Donald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about. 
Ultimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trump’s plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clinton’s plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction.

Hopefully his changes will spur economic growth which will bring in more revenue as more jobs are created, not saying it will, just speculating that this is his plan. SnodtBlossom 
he won’t be elected anonymous 
Nobody is elected, they are selected. Elections are just a way to keep dumb-downed masses in check. So keep voting Lazarovic 
You’re stupid, that’s why you’re anonymous. Coward too. anonymous

just like in Ancient Rome election season is bread and circus , keep the masses entertained so they won’t notice they’re powerless and gullible BS1986 
She’ll use that in the debate. BS1986 
he wants to be coronated , all hail Trumpus Maximus ThePeanut995 
You are in for a rude awakening GSOB 
We all are, if either one is elected. I’ve done my research. No choice is without risk. Trump is who I’d like to see. It’s time to think outside the box. 
If he gets in, perhaps in a 2nd term, the Fed Reserve get’s axed. 
I can’t stop thinking big with Mr. Trump. I can’t stop thinking small with the leftist. GSOB 
With more than 50% leftist population….it does look like the final nail. Alan Cecil 
Bwah ha ha ha…another twist on the “trickle-down” theory. It works great…for the top 1%. hillery comin for your guns 
then there’s hillery’s economic “plan”, massive across the board tax increases,massive increases in the size of gov’t,staggering draw droppin deficits,massive increases in entitlements (handouts),after all she did say she was continuing beewok obambi failed policies Mondobeyondo 
I have never felt as depressed – about my own future, about the future of my friends, my family and my country- as I do at this very moment. William Lutz 
Mondo I’m feeling the same way. Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day. I’ve noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis, but even more so after Obama got reelected. The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years. This downfall is inevitable. anonymous 
You’re not the only one. Jerry C 
Most of us felt that way almost 8 years ago. rat28 
Another stupid tickle down economy by the GOP.. We should be taxing the rich . Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick .. repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years.. Bad deal from Donald Trump. libs credit card economics 
yeah just let the 35 year old “kids” livin in their parents basement worry bout the 12T of red ink,and that’s just in 8 years GSOB 
Which is impossible to pay off. South Texas 
The stupid in your comment just burns. I’ve not met one person who is retired who has benefited from the wonders of Obummacare. Their cost went way up for less choice and service. Maybe you could go get a medical degree and offer our services for free and help out with the problem.

oh Snotty, you just want to rub your fingers through his thick blond weave, don’t you SnodtBlossom 
What I’m saying is.. If you vote for Trump and you’re single and admit to voting for him,.. a lot of women won’t want you. GSOB 
Let me be blunt – God called women into spiritual leadership roles, as an exception to His design, in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God, and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church, the home and in the nation. 
In no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing, but it is something God uses to shame the men into action. SnodtBlossom

Michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written. You presented Trump’s solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans. Well done. This is not satire. 
Trump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else. William Lutz 
Replace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments. Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea. South Texas 
No, the government needs to get out of looting me with a ‘savings account’ and make it free market all the way. GSOB 
You don’t understand how it works. They don’t tax those dollars you put into a HSA. Orange Jean 
Except that in most of them… you select a certain $$ amount each year… and if you don’t use it, you lose it. Who do you think ends up with the money then? GSOB 
Don’t expect a reward for being careless. No system can sustain carelessness South Texas 
Exactly my point. Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to ‘let’ me do something with my money? 
I’ve never had a use for an HSA but known people who do. But hey, at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by ‘giving’ us the privilege to use our money pre-tax. 
If some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector, this would be a non issue. SnodtBlossom

How much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. it’s only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next we’ll grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery! 
Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being ” The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II” and Grant “Commanding General of the United States Army” How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! 
“no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trump’s casino empire in the last 30 years.” He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks it’s just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Raymond Chow 
Political experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation. Cobbett 
”How much prior political experience does Trump have” 
Oh yes…there’s Iraq, Libya, Syria(she was also instrumental in convincing Bill to bomb Serbia….all resounding success stories…politics just equal BS. turee60 
How much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none! jonodough 
you mean like the idiot obama? Mondobeyondo 
If she doesn’t have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election. LIZ THE SHIZ 
yup, the fix is in just watch the electoral college , your vote don’t mean squat!!! GSOB 
Not yet it don’t Raymond Chow 
Why do people always mention electoral college when they don’t understand what electoral college is? 
When looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesn’t mean electoral college. Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state. All states in the national election are winner take all. So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college. LIZ THE SHIZ 
just like super delegates, seems fishy budman 
nebraska is not winner take all. each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district. GSOB 
And the minimum wage will go up. And unemployment will rise, and government will spend even more. Orange Jean 
… yeah, and little pink pigs will fly away from Smithfield Foods and not get turned into hams! ISA41:10 
Yep! krinks 
Hey Genius. A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition. A Whistle Blower for/from the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much. The more she came up with creative reasons to deny payment/coverage the higher she was promoted. GSOB 
The free market is the best thing going! Because it has some level of risk, non hackers despise and envy this good system. What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people, not all. No system can. What happens if the majority are non hackers? Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry, they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone. The market then is no longer free. krinks 
Weren’t you paying attention? They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment. GSOB 
Appeal it then. krinks 
Appeal? To who? The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no? Are you an idiot? GSOB 
You sound like a confident young man. Just ignore me. Stick with your leftist ideas. Your choice. Jace Tate 
the once estudious michael snider is now drowned by drivel. LIZ THE SHIZ 
well he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow

Then sue them or perhaps you didn’t sign up for the coverage. It’s like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident. joe 
That’s how “insurance” works. Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors, IE banksters intended. Raymond Chow 
Yes, a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries. I.e., wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where it’s lower even though I live in California. Cobbett 
Why are people so obsessed with their health? Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I ”might” get ill…rather spend it on women and booze. Lillian DeVore

I agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world. People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better. The government doesn’t need to get into our medical. Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didn’t cost me anything. William Lutz 
I agree. On one hand, some of Trump’s policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore: 
1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. It’s a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He should’ve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate 
Isis took the oil didn’t they William Lutz 
Yeah they probably took it, but my point is that you don’t easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called “war on terror”, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please. Christopher Privett 
Obama expanded Bush’s programs of surveillance, and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars. For a WALL built across their southern border. John Francis 
You are right, some things don’t add up, but I’ll take him over Hillary any day of the week. I’m still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all, having a very hard time with Trump’s torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden. Jessy Scholl 
Seriously, Donald Trump can’t talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot. Jace Tate 
how are lower taxes going to help zero growth? How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery? Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy, you don’t think there is any fixing it. I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes. That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything, the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions. themacabre 
How are higher taxes for failed government programs going to help?…we need to cut federal spending not give it more money. That’s like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack. ISA41:10 
” I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. ” 
How stupid can you be?!?!? Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector (businesses and people) improves growth and the economy?

You are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working. It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution. 
When a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin, then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness. 
There is a slim…very slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years, but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss. 
Don’t believe it? It is in the book; the only book that matters. sister soldier

Removing Obamacare and reducing Defense budget will be huge saving for US. And will be good for rest of the world…. William Lutz 
Trump however, will not reduce military spending and his idea of replacing ACA is only a secret plan. SnodtBlossom

ask JFK what happens when you try to go after the fed, you can’t can you? Priszilla",FAKE,archives michael on television  things that every american should know about donald trumps plan to save the us economy by michael snyder on september th  can donald trump turn the us economy around this week trump unveiled details of his new economic plan and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it  but the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that barack obama hillary clinton and the democrats have us on right now millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country  the middle class is dying  poverty is exploding  millions of children in america dont have enough food  and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet  something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion so is donald trump the man for the hour if you would like to read his full economic plan you can find it on his official campaign website  his plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest economic recovery since the great depression last weeks gdp report showed that the economy grew a mere  in the second quarter and  over the last year its the weakest recovery since the great depression  the predictable consequence of massive taxation regulation oneside trade deals and onerous energy restrictions and trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been so how would he fix things the following are  things that every american should know about donald trumps plan to save the us economy  donald trump would lower taxes on the middle class the tax savings under trumps plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families the following numbers come from a recent charisma article   a married couple earning  per year with two children and  in child care expenses will save  from their current tax bill  a married couple earning  per year with two children and  in child care expenses will receive a  reduction in their tax bill  married couple earning  million per year with two children and  in child care expenses will get only a  reduction in their tax bill  donald trump would lower taxes on businesses under his plan no business in america would be taxed more than  percent alternatively hillary clintons plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to  percent so trumps plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses and it would encourage many that have left the country to return but where would the lost tax revenue be made up  childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation for working families with children this would be a great blessing without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women and this is a demographic that trump has been struggling with it is definitely an idea that i support but once again where will the money come from to pay for this  us manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment this would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment but it would also reduce tax revenue as an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in america  but it would also likely increase the budget deficit  a temporary freeze on new regulations red tape is one of my big pet peeves and so i greatly applaud trump for this proposal i think that bob eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about trumps planned freeze on new regulations in  alone federal agencies issued over  final rules and regulations up from  the prior year studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average us business and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to nearly  per us household annually excessive regulation is costing our country as much as  trillion dollars per year and trump will end it  all existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated in particular trumps plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring the following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website  the environmental protection agencys clean power plan which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas raising electricity rates the epas waters of the united states rule which gives the epa the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land limiting land use and the department of interiors moratorium on coal mining permits which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work  donald trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe donald trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy i write about this all the time  and it is a hot button issue for me so i definitely applaud trump for proposing the following  appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for america narrowing our trade deficit increasing domestic production and getting a fair deal for our workers renegotiate nafta bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization label china a currency manipulator apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat direct the commerce department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations  donald trumps plan would be a tremendous boost for the us energy industry barack obama promised to kill the coal industry and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept obama also killed the keystone pipeline and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession to turn things around trump would do the following  rescind all the jobdestroying obama executive actions including the climate action plan and the waters of the us rule save the coal industry and other industries threatened by hillary clintons extremist agenda ask trans canada to renew its permit application for the keystone pipeline make land in the outer continental shelf available to produce oil and natural gas cancel the paris climate agreement limit global warming to  degrees celsius and stop all payments of us tax dollars to un global warming programs  trump would repeal obamacare trump claims that obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years and without a doubt it has already cost the us economy a lot of jobs  not only that but obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families trump says that he would replace obamacare but that is a rather vague statement what exactly would he replace it with  trumps plan says nothing about the federal reserve this is a great concern because the federal reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does it is at the very heart of our debtbased system and unless something is done about the fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger since the federal reserve was created in  the value of the us dollar has fallen by more than  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger for trump to not even mention the federal reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight we are in the midst of a longterm economic decline and things have not gotten better during the obama years if you can believe it a study that was just released by harvard even acknowledges this  americas economic performance peaked in the late s and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth productivity growth job growth and investment began well before the great recession workforce participation the proportion of americans in the productive workforce peaked in  with fewer workingage men and women in the workforce percapita income for the us is reduced median real household income has declined since  with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels despite a welcome jump in  median household income remains below the peak attained in   years ago moreover stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lowerincome and lowerskilled americans leading inequality to rise that same study found that the percentage of americans participating in the labor force peaked back in  and has been steadily declining since that time if we continue to do the same things we will continue to get the same results donald trump is promising change and many of his proposals sound good but there are also some areas to be concerned about ultimately just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the us economy around we need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems and trumps plan stops well short of that but without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to hillary clintons plan and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction more jobs shipped out of the country ford moves all small car production to mexico  trump will have an accident butbutbut but but obammy mammy said donald trump will never ever become presidenthis words ver batembawok also said donald trump will never replace me in the whominous disturbing words from el presidentwhat exactly did baaaarak mean obamas red line  obama did say trump will never become presidentnot on his watchfor him that was a red linebut lets face it we all know barrys track record when it comes to red lines lol jc teecher it will only happen the way the obominable one says it will happen if the creator on the throne says it will barry oldwater hopefully his changes will spur economic growth which will bring in more revenue as more jobs are created not saying it will just speculating that

and my country as i do at this very moment william lutz mondo im feeling the same way everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day ive noticed it ever since the

only one jerry c most of us felt that way almost  years ago rat another stupid tickle down economy by the gop we should be taxing the rich  obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global

for trump and youre single and admit to voting for him a lot of women wont want you gsob let me be blunt  god called women into spiritual leadership roles as an exception to his design in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to god and into exercising their god given responsibility to lead in the church the home and in the nation in no way does the bible ever paint women in

theyll be the ugly women not the mindless bleach blond fox news types satirist  michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written you presented trumps solutions to issues that plague everyday americans well done this is not satire trump should replace ocare with the free market and nothing else william lutz replace obamacare with individual health savings accounts based on investments public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea south texas no the government needs to get out of looting me with a savings account and make it free market all the way gsob you dont understand how it works they dont tax those dollars you put into a hsa orange jean except that in most of them you select a certain  amount each year and if you dont use it you lose it who do you think ends up with the money then gsob dont expect a reward for being careless no system can sustain carelessness south texas exactly my point why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to let me do something with my money ive never had a use for an hsa but known people who do but hey at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by giving us the privilege to use our money pretax if some of us were not working almost  months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector this would be a non

2115.0,The next president can have a big impact on climate policy — even without Congress,"Given that Congress has become so utterly dysfunctional in recent years, it's tempting to think the upcoming presidential election will be fairly low-stakes. Does it even matter what Jeb Bush thinks about tax policy or what Hillary Clinton is proposing on paid leave? Hardly anything will pass.

The next president won't need Congress to tackle global warming

But on global warming, it's a rather different story. Whoever gets elected to the White House in 2016 will have an enormous amount of influence over America’s climate policies — and they won't need Congress to act.

For that, you can thank (or blame) President Obama. Over the past six years, the Environmental Protection Agency has acquired unprecedented authority to regulate the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. Obama has used that power to enact a slew of new pollution rules, including CO2 regulations on coal plants, all with the aim of cutting US greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025.

The EPA will likely keep this authority to regulate carbon dioxide for the foreseeable future — unless it gets altered by courts or repealed by Congress. And many of the biggest decisions on how to use it will be left to the next president.

If, say, Hillary Clinton wanted to expand Obama’s carbon rules to oil refineries or cement plants, she could. Conversely, if a Republican president skeptical of climate change wanted to bog down implementation of Obama’s CO2 rules for coal plants, he'd be able to do that, too. (Though, as we'll see, Republicans may not have unlimited power to scuttle Obama's climate policies.)

""Any future administration will have a lot of room to be either more ambitious or less ambitious,"" explains Michael Wara, an expert on energy and environmental law at Stanford. And how the next president uses the EPA could have ripple effects around the world — and even decide the fate of ongoing international climate talks with China, India, and other countries.

So far, the 2016 candidates have been vague about which way they'd steer the EPA. Clinton has said Obama's climate rules should be ""protected at all cost,"" but she's given little sign of whether she might expand them further. Meanwhile, Republicans like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush sound skeptical about tackling global warming, but they haven't said whether they might try to relax or even dismantle Obama's climate policies. So here's a look at what they could do.

First, a recap of how the executive branch acquired so much power over US climate policy. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the existing Clean Air Act — if there's evidence that they endanger public health and welfare.

In 2009, Obama's EPA laid out this evidence, and that ""endangerment finding"" set in motion a series of rules to curtail US greenhouse gas emissions. Since this was being done under the auspices of the Clean Air Act, a law Congress had passed in 1970, no new legislation was required. The EPA could act on its own. The big actions so far:

Add it all up, and the White House claims these rules put the US on pace to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025. But whether that actually happens will depend on the next president.

Okay, now let's assume it's 2017. There's a new president, and Congress is still totally gridlocked on climate change. What happens next?

The next president likely won't be able to dismantle Obama's climate policies entirely — not on his or her own. After all, the Supreme Court has effectively ordered the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases so long as there's evidence that they cause harm, and that evidence is quite solid. Only Congress could undo everything Obama's done, by revising the Clean Air Act.

Still, whoever occupies the White House and EPA will have a lot of say in how to implement Obama's climate rules. That sounds boring, but it's actually a key step. There's tons of leeway to strengthen or weaken these rules. Here are a few ways this could play out:

1) Fuel-economy standards could be tightened (or weakened) in 2017. Remember, the EPA's fuel-economy standards for new cars and light trucks are on pace to rise from their current 35 miles per gallon to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

Automakers may push to relax the CAFE standards in the midterm review

Yet those numbers aren't set in stone. These CAFE (corporate average fuel economy) rules are scheduled to come up for a midterm review in 2017. At that point, automakers may lobby to allow the standards to rise more slowly — particularly if sales of fuel-efficient vehicles have been sluggish due to low oil prices. Green groups, meanwhile, could push to make the standards stricter, or to have them keep increasing past 2025, to push vehicle emissions down even further.

So the next administration will have to decide. Leave the vehicle standards alone? Make them stricter? Weaker?

The one twist here is that due to a longstanding quirk of the Clean Air Act, California can threaten to create its own stricter standards if it's not happy with what the federal government is doing (and other states can join). Automakers really hate the idea of multiple sets of vehicle standards around the country, so they may prefer not to weaken the federal rules too much and risk having California go it alone.

2) The Clean Power Plan will live or die based on implementation. The EPA will finalize its rules for reducing carbon dioxide from existing power plants in the summer of 2015. It's a core component of Obama's climate policy — power plants are responsible for 31 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. But the next president will have enormous influence over how this plan actually works.

Assuming the rule holds up in court, it could prove difficult for the next president to simply hit the kill switch on the plan and start all over. But he or she will get to decide how to implement it — and that's arguably just as significant. After the rule is finalized, states will have another 14 months to submit plans for cutting emissions, though some will request extensions. That process could drag on until 2017 or 2018.

""There's a lot of latitude in the review process""

At that point, the EPA will review each state's plans for reducing emissions from its power plants and decide whether the plans are acceptable. An administration that really wants to tackle climate change can make sure states are doing as much as is feasible. By contrast, a president who was less concerned about global warming could allow states that wanted to, like Texas, to submit less-aggressive plans.

""There’s a lot of latitude in the review process,"" says Stanford's Michael Wara. ""The history of the Clean Air Act shows this. If you have a president who doesn’t like climate policy, they could basically signal to the states that they’re going to give a lot of compliance flexibility and allow states to make assumptions in their plan that reduce their costs."" This would likely involve seemingly arcane tweaks to models and baselines that would be harder for green groups to challenge in court.

Meanwhile, some states may outright refuse to submit any plans for reducing emissions. (Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, is already urging states to do exactly this.) If that happens, the EPA has the authority to impose its own federal plan on the states. The agency will unveil the details of this federal plan in 2015, though, again, implementation would be left to the next president.

Meanwhile, industry groups are almost certain to challenge aspects of the rule in court. Adele Morris, the policy director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution, points out that an administration hostile to Obama's EPA rule could defend it weakly in court. And if any parts of the rule get struck down, the next administration will get to decide how to redo it.

It all comes down to preference. ""If you have an administration that's friendly to [Obama's] policy, then you'd have continuity in implementation,"" says David Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate and clear air program. ""But if you had an administration that wasn't as friendly, they could try to drag their feet or change the rules.""

3) The next president will decide whether to regulate other sectors — like refineries. The Clean Air Act doesn't just cover vehicles and power plants. Technically the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from other sources, as well. Oil refineries. Cement plants. Trucks. Airplanes. The agency is regulating methane leaks from new oil and gas wells, but it hasn't touched existing wells. And so on. These sources all add up.

The Obama administration is leaving most of the decisions about what to do with these sectors to the next president. If Hillary Clinton comes in and wants to expand the EPA's authority here, she can. If Marco Rubio comes in and doesn't, he may have to fend off lawsuits, but he can likely hold off on doing this for a long time.

At this point, we only have a hazy sense for what most US presidential candidates think about global warming. But given how much power they have at their disposal, they should give more detailed answers.

For instance, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, claims that she'll put climate change and clean energy at the ""top of the agenda."" And Clinton has said the EPA's climate rules should be ""protected at all cost.""

Hillary says the EPA rules should be ""protected"" — but would she expand them?

Fine. So we know she'll veto any attempts by congressional Republicans to repeal the EPA rules altogether. But what else? Would she try to strengthen the fuel-economy rules during the 2017 midterm review? Would she want to expand the EPA's carbon regulations to oil refineries and chemical plants? Would she try to beat Obama's goal of cutting emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025?

On the other end of the spectrum, there's Marco Rubio, who says, ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it."" But what does that mean in practice? Would he weaken the vehicle rules? Abandon the US goal of cutting emissions 26 percent?

Then there's Jeb Bush, who says he's ""concerned"" about climate change and that ""we need to work with the rest of the world to negotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions."" But, again, what does this mean? Would he keep Obama's climate rules in place? Strengthen them? Weaken them?

Some green groups have started to focus on these questions. ""We definitely want to ensure that the next president is actually committed on building progress through the Clean Power Plan,"" Tiernan Sittenfield, senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters, told me.

For now, many environmentalists have mainly been pressing Clinton on what she thinks of the Keystone XL pipeline. Yet that issue will probably be resolved before Obama leaves office. The EPA rules are far more relevant for the next administration.

It's worth being precise about what the EPA can and can't do here. The executive branch has acquired sweeping authority over the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration estimates that this authority alone could push emissions down 26 to 28 percent between 2005 and 2025.

truly drastic changes to our energy system would likely require Congress

Looked at one way, that's a huge deal — a decisive break from the past, when emissions would go up and up seemingly without end. Looked at another way, it's a pittance.

To help avoid drastic global warming, the United States will probably need to push down emissions 80 percent or more by midcentury. That would require truly staggering changes. It wouldn't be enough for coal and gas plants to get slightly more efficient under EPA rules. We'd have to replace virtually our entire energy system with a new, cleaner one.

That's the sort of thing that only Congress can really do. Only Congress can fund R&D for new technologies or offer subsidies for clean energy. Only Congress can bring about dramatic changes to our grid infrastructure. Only Congress can enact an economy-wide carbon tax. Barring some creative flexibility on regulations, these are things the next president just can't accomplish without cooperation from the House and Senate.

Where the EPA rules could have a more important effect is on the international stage — at least in the near term. Remember, the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. There's also China, India, Brazil, Europe, Russia, and so on. That's why international cooperation on climate change is so crucial.

Right now, the world is groping toward a very, very weak international agreement. The US put forward its pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025. That spurred China to respond by vowing to get its emissions to peak around 2030. Other countries have started to pitch in, too.

Add all these pledges up, and we're still not close to tackling global warming. The Climate Action Tracker estimates that we're on pace for global average temperatures to rise 3.1°C (or 5.6°F) above pre-industrial levels, give or take — a seriously disruptive change.

""What the US has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamics""

Even so, some experts think even these weak promises could lead, iteratively, to stronger action over time. ""You can see how those plans could start to connect together and create a positive negotiating dynamic,"" David Victor, a political scientist at UC San Diego's School of International Relations and Pacific Studies, told me. ""The encouraging precedent here is in trade ... You build credibility and trust over time and then move to bigger issues.""

The next US president can help decide how this agreement continues to evolve in the years to come. The US can keep pushing its own emissions down and try to persuade countries like China and India to respond in kind. Or it could abandon this budding framework entirely.

Abandoning the US climate targets, says Wara, ""would do real damage to whatever credibility the US has left on the international stage. What Obama has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamics in a very positive way. And if the US were to walk away from that, that would be very damaging for future climate negotiations and commitments.""",REAL,given that congress has become so utterly dysfunctional in recent years

According to the Pew Research Center’s latest numbers, in 2014, 275,000 anchor babies were born in the United States — enough to fill Orlando, Florida. 
The Washington Examiner reported : 
Moms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
The data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. 
The report reviews births to unmarried foreign-born and American born women. Those who are foreign born, including illegals, are seeing their birthrate drop, though it is still making up for the decline in births by American women. 
Pew’s recently-released report read: “In 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers.” The share of new mothers who are teenagers is higher among the U.S. born (6%) than among the foreign born (2%) https://t.co/d6f9C9ALoR pic.twitter.com/ydJpV2NgXh 
— Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 
“A third of all births to foreign-born mothers were to unmarried women – down from a peak of 37 percent in 2008. At the same time, the rate has held steady for U.S.-born women and now stands at 42 percent,” the study continued. 
According to Pew, the birthrate among U.S.-born women has declined, so the rise in the birthrate is solely because of immigrant mothers. The growth in annual U.S. births since 1970 has been driven entirely by immigrant moms https://t.co/bhzGRzgimg pic.twitter.com/dozNVXXVgT

While the annual number of babies born in the U.S. has fluctuated in recent years – most markedly during the Great Recession when there was a significant drop in births nationwide – the trajectory over the past four decades or so has been upward. In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970. 
This growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014. 
So, do you think that all these people coming here, in many cases illegally, have assimilated to our culture and/or are planning on doing so? Take a look around and it’s easy to see that the answer is no. 
If Hillary Clinton is elected, she plans to greatly increase refugee flows and give amnesty to illegal immigrants who broke our laws. In contrast, Donald Trump has pledged to restore law and order, build a wall, enforce immigration laws, and put the safety and interests of American citizens first.

6350.0,Mother And Daughter Remind MSNBC Reporter That Trump Has Black Supporters,"Sharpton Attacks O’Keefe, So O’Keefe Releases Brutal Expose on Sharpton… BOOM! 
If you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire, though, MSNBC is by far my favorite — and trust me, a year-and-a-half of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the left-slanting morass. 
MSNBC pretends that conservatives and Trump supporters are from another planet — or, at the very least, another culture, a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness. 
This interaction with MSNBC reporter Jacob Rascon on Wednesday proved what I’m talking about perfectly. He had found a mother and daughter in line, apparently for early voting. They were also African-American, which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult, by liberal media standards.   
However, when he asked them about criticism of Trump’s African-American outreach, the mother and daughter blew him out of the water. 
“Well, I think Trump is reaching out to all citizens, including African-Americans,” Trina, the daughter, told MSNBC. “He’s trying to address a problem. It should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong, and you have a plan that wants to help people.” 
“That’s what a president should do for us. He should reach out and try to help people and address problems that’s going on in our country.” 
“Some of the criticisms have been about (Trump’s pitch to minority voters) ‘What do you have to lose?’” Rascon said to Gloria, the mother. “What do you think about that criticism?”  ",FAKE,sharpton attacks okeefe so okeefe releases brutal expose on sharpton boom if you are going to wallow in the liberal media mire though msnbc is by far my favorite  and trust me a yearandahalf of observing presidential campaigns has made me quite a connoisseur of the leftslanting morass msnbc pretends that conservatives and trump supporters are from another planet  or at the very least another culture a sort of cargo cult that is to be studied anthropologically but never taken with any seriousness this interaction with msnbc reporter jacob rascon on wednesday proved what im talking about perfectly he had found a mother and daughter in line apparently for early voting they were also africanamerican which made them a cargo cult on top of a cargo cult by liberal media standards however when he asked them about criticism of trumps africanamerican outreach the mother and daughter blew him out of the water well i think trump is reaching out to all citizens including africanamericans trina the daughter told msnbc hes trying to address a problem it should not be a problem if you address there is something wrong and you have a plan that wants to help people thats what a president should do for us he should reach out and try to help people and address problems thats going on in our country some of the criticisms have been about trumps pitch to minority voters what do you have to lose rascon said to gloria the mother what do you think about that criticism ,"['sharpton', 'attacks', 'okeefe', 'okeefe', 'releases', 'brutal', 'expose', 'sharpton', 'boom', 'going', 'wallow', 'liberal', 'media', 'mire', 'though', 'msnbc', 'far', 'favorite', 'trust', 'yearandahalf', 'observing', 'presidential', 'campaigns', 'made', 'quite', 'connoisseur', 'leftslanting', 'morass', 'msnbc', 'pretends', 'conservatives', 'trump', 'supporters', 'another', 'planet', 'least', 'another', 'culture', 'sort', 'cargo', 'cult', 'studied', 'anthropologically', 'never', 'taken', 'seriousness', 'interaction', 'msnbc', 'reporter', 'jacob', 'rascon', 'wednesday', 'proved', 'im', 'talking', 'perfectly', 'found', 'mother', 'daughter', 'line', 'apparently', 'early', 'voting', 'also', 'africanamerican', 'made', 'cargo', 'cult', 'top', 'cargo', 'cult', 'liberal', 'media', 'standards', 'however', 'asked', 'criticism', 'trumps', 'africanamerican', 'outreach', 'mother', 'daughter', 'blew', 'water', 'well', 'think', 'trump', 'reaching', 'citizens', 'including', 'africanamericans', 'trina', 'daughter', 'told', 'msnbc', 'hes', 'trying', 'address', 'problem', 'problem', 'address', 'something', 'wrong', 'plan', 'wants', 'help', 'people', 'thats', 'president', 'us', 'reach', 'try', 'help', 'people', 'address', 'problems', 'thats', 'going', 'country', 'criticisms', 'trumps', 'pitch', 'minority', 'voters', 'lose', 'rascon', 'said', 'gloria', 'mother', 'think', 'criticism']","['PERSON', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORG', 'NORP', 'ORG']","{'ORG': 5, 'PERSON': 2, 'DATE': 1, 'NORP': 1}",5,2,0,255,0.0685,48
4597.0,Justice Department Staffers Monitor Polls on Election Day,"More than 500 staffers from the Justice Department will be monitoring polling stations across 28 states Tuesday.

Those staffers have been dispatched to 67 jurisdictions and will be watching for civil rights violations, including racial discrimination.

""As always, our personnel will perform these duties impartially with one goal in mind: to see to it that every eligible voter can participate in our elections to the full extent that federal law provides,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday.

     

 The announcement comes amid rising concerns about voter intimidation.

""Observation at the polls should not cross the line into intimidation, that's key,"" The Christian Science Monitor quoted Ned Foley, a constitutional law professor at Ohio State University's Moritz School of Law.

On the other hand, there have also been concerns about voter fraud, with some 41 percent of Americans believing the election could be stolen, according to a new Politico/Morning Consult poll.

Speaking at a restaurant and bar in Anderson Township, Ohio, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin defended recent claims by Donald Trump that the election could be rigged.

""Of course he gets crucified by the press saying he's conspiratorial or something, saying there could be voter fraud,"" she said. ""Well, primaries can be fixed, and debate questions can be fixed, and dead people can vote.""

     

 In 2012, about 780 monitors were dispatched. This year, that number is down by about 35 percent.

7818.0,Elizabeth Warren Just Blasted The FBI Director For Going After Hillary Instead Of Wall Street Crooks,"Comments 
In the wake of a string of completely extraordinary revelations starting this summer by FBI Director James Comey, Senator Warren is now demanding that the FBI release investigatory details about the 14 corporations and 11 individuals which the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) referred for criminal prosecution in 2010; 
“Your recent actions with regard to the investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provide a clear precedent for releasing additional information about the investigation of the parties responsible for the financial crisis. 
These new standards present a compelling case for public transparency around the fate of the FCIC referrals. If Secretary Clinton’s email server was of sufficient interest to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. 
As a consequence of the 2008 crash, trillions of dollars in American housing wealth was destroyed. Millions of Americans were touched personally as they lost their homes, their jobs, or both. Hundreds of pension funds were eviscerated, and millions of retirees saw their financial futures wiped out. Congress created the FCIC to examine what went wrong and to determine Whether any individuals or entities deserved law enforcement scrutiny as a result of their actions in this crisis. The FCIC followed the law and sent such referrals to the DOJ, yet not a single senior Wall Street executive has ever been criminally prosecuted. 
For the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of intense public interest about which the American people deserve the details than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.” 
Until now, the FBI has never, ever released the investigatory file of anyone or any institution it has targeted. However, if the Democratic nominee herself was a bank, then she would have nothing to fear from the FBI. 
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is laser focused on protecting the American people from shady banks and financial scams, but the newly transparent FBI apparently doesn’t share her concern since those investigations don’t involve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. To date, no executive has been criminally prosecuted for financial crimes by banks, Wall Street firms and lending institutions which caused the Great Bush Recession’s mass unemployment and foreclosure epidemic. 
Of 25 entities named by the FCIC to be criminally investigated , only one actual person has paid a civil penalty, and another person – none other than Daniel Mudd, former CEO of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, was fined — but had his $100,000 penalty paid by the government sponsored enterprise that employed him. 
FBI Director James Comey has deployed a massive double standard to protect the criminal financial institutions, handing them a free pass and complete secrecy for collapsing our national economy and wiping out $3 Trillion dollars in home equity, stock equity and savings, while dragging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton through the mud for Comey’s partisan predilections for transparency when she’s demonstrably done absolutely nothing wrong. 
The FBI Director himself admitted in July that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against the Democratic nominee, yet he himself cannot resist rehashing and releasing the investigatory details in public over and over. Releasing anything about an investigation, or even delivering an actual indictment, actually violates Department of Justice policy to remain silent in the 60 days before an election. It’s been described by former top Justice Department officials as the “difference between being independent and flying solo.” 
Elizabeth is right. How long will the FBI wait to deliver transparency to the American people eight years after their jobs, homes and savings were attacked by irresponsible bankers? 
Once the FBI completes disclosing those investigatory files, then how long will it take for them to deliver indictments and justice to the men and women who caused the Great Recession? 
Neither can happen soon enough. For now, he needs to stop his partisan witch-hunt against Hillary and start going after the real crook.s",FAKE,comments in the wake of a string of completely extraordinary revelations starting this

677.0,Poll: 71 percent of Dems think Clinton should keep running even if indicted,"A strong majority of Democratic voters think Hillary Clinton should keep running for president even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while secretary of state, according to a new poll.

Clinton was strongly criticized in a State Department inspector general report last week about her email use.

The report found repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told “never to speak of the Secretary’s personal email system again.”

Yet, this seems not to be a big issue among Democrats. The Rasmussen poll released Tuesday found 71 percent of Democratic voters believe she should keep running even if indicted, a view shared by only 30 percent of Republicans and 46 percent of unaffiliated voters. Overall, 50 percent of those polled said she should keep running.

The FBI investigation into her email practices is still ongoing. Democratic primary rival Bernie Sanders has avoided commenting specifically on that probe, but campaign manager Jeff Weaver on Wednesday questioned whether she could keep going if an indictment comes down.

""That would be difficult to continue running a race,"" Weaver told Fox News on Wednesday, when asked about the poll.

The email scandal could still be problematic for Clinton's general election hopes, with 40 percent of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for Clinton because of it -- though 48 percent of voters said it would have no impact on their vote.

The Democratic primary frontrunner’s argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is also apparently failing to sway many voters. According to the poll, 65 percent of voters consider it likely that Clinton broke the law with her email use, with 47 percent saying it’s very likely.

The poll of 1,000 likely voters was conducted May 29-30. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",REAL,a strong majority of democratic voters think hillary clinton should keep running for president even if she is charged with a felony in connection with her private email use while secretary of state according to a new poll clinton was strongly criticized in a state department inspector general report last week about her email use the report found repeated warnings about cybersecurity were ignored and staffers who expressed concerns were told never to speak of the secretarys personal email system again yet this seems not to be a big issue among democrats the rasmussen poll released tuesday found  percent of democratic voters believe she should keep running even if indicted a view shared by only  percent of republicans and  percent of unaffiliated voters overall  percent of those polled said she should keep running the fbi investigation into her email practices is still ongoing democratic primary rival bernie sanders has avoided commenting specifically on that probe but campaign manager jeff weaver on wednesday questioned whether she could keep going if an indictment comes down that would be difficult to continue running a race weaver told fox news on wednesday when asked about the poll the email scandal could still be problematic for clintons general election hopes with  percent of all voters saying they are less likely to vote for clinton because of it  though  percent of voters said it would have no impact on their vote the democratic primary frontrunners argument that she did nothing illegal with her email use is also apparently failing to sway many voters according to the poll  percent of voters consider it likely that clinton broke the law with her email use with  percent saying its very likely the poll of  likely voters was conducted may  it had a margin of error of  percentage points,"['strong', 'majority', 'democratic', 'voters', 'think', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'keep', 'running', 'president', 'even', 'charged', 'felony', 'connection', 'private', 'email', 'use', 'secretary', 'state', 'according', 'new', 'poll', 'clinton', 'strongly', 'criticized', 'state', 'department', 'inspector', 'general', 'report', 'last', 'week', 'email', 'use', 'report', 'found', 'repeated', 'warnings', 'cybersecurity', 'ignored', 'staffers', 'expressed', 'concerns', 'told', 'never', 'speak', 'secretarys', 'personal', 'email', 'system', 'yet', 'seems', 'big', 'issue', 'among', 'democrats', 'rasmussen', 'poll', 'released', 'tuesday', 'found', 'percent', 'democratic', 'voters', 'believe', 'keep', 'running', 'even', 'indicted', 'view', 'shared', 'percent', 'republicans', 'percent', 'unaffiliated', 'voters', 'overall', 'percent', 'polled', 'said', 'keep', 'running', 'fbi', 'investigation', 'email', 'practices', 'still', 'ongoing', 'democratic', 'primary', 'rival', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'avoided', 'commenting', 'specifically', 'probe', 'campaign', 'manager', 'jeff', 'weaver', 'wednesday', 'questioned', 'whether', 'could', 'keep', 'going', 'indictment', 'comes', 'would', 'difficult', 'continue', 'running', 'race', 'weaver', 'told', 'fox', 'news', 'wednesday', 'asked', 'poll', 'email', 'scandal', 'could', 'still', 'problematic', 'clintons', 'general', 'election', 'hopes', 'percent', 'voters', 'saying', 'less', 'likely', 'vote', 'clinton', 'though', 'percent', 'voters', 'said', 'would', 'impact', 'vote', 'democratic', 'primary', 'frontrunners', 'argument', 'nothing', 'illegal', 'email', 'use', 'also', 'apparently', 'failing', 'sway', 'many', 'voters', 'according', 'poll', 'percent', 'voters', 'consider', 'likely', 'clinton', 'broke', 'law', 'email', 'use', 'percent', 'saying', 'likely', 'poll', 'likely', 'voters', 'conducted', 'may', 'margin', 'error', 'percentage', 'points']","['PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'NORP', 'DATE', 'PERCENT', 'NORP', 'ORG', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON']","{'PERSON': 6, 'DATE': 4, 'NORP': 2, 'PERCENT': 1, 'ORG': 1}",1,6,0,299,0.049165568730786126,35

3004.0,Is the Iran deal unraveling? Think again. | Institution,"Are the wheels coming off the Iran deal? Less than a year after Iran, America, and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord, a debate over its terms has erupted anew.

In Washington, the braggadocio of a prominent White House aide is fueling Republican accusations that President Obama deliberately deceived the Congress and the country about Iran and the deal. And in Tehran, frustration over the residual impact of American sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from Iranian leaders that the United States has failed to live up to its end of the bargain. As a result, some are fretting that the deal is “at risk” and are laying blame on the White House doorstep.

Both claims are spurious, and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the Obama administration. In the end, however, the ruckus over recent comments by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is largely an inside-the-Beltway drama—one that provides endless entertainment for Washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or American diplomacy.

By contrast, Iran’s dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for Washington. But it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is “unraveling.” Rather, the chorus of complaints from Tehran demonstrates the accord signed in July 2015 is working exactly as it was intended—forestalling Iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economy.

Obama’s handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility. For the sake of the deal, and for any prospect of a durable Thermidor for the revolutionary state, Washington should resist the temptation to assuage Iran’s post-deal growing pains. If Iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation, their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield that—in other words, meaningful political, economic, and foreign policy reform.

Not surprisingly, Iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix, and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from Washington. Their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed. On an April visit to Washington, Valiollah Seif, the head of Iran’s Central Bank, questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement, insisting that Tehran has received “almost nothing” of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country’s smooth-spoken foreign minister, has contended that “the United States needs to do way more,” warning that “if one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falter.”

And Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, charged recently that “the Americans are engaged in obstruction and deception, adding: “on paper, the Americans say banks can trade with Iran but in practice they act in such an Iranophobic way that no trade can take place with Iran.”

Adding fuel to the fire are changes to U.S. visa policies that are perceived at constraining Iran’s economic rebound, deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the U.S. Congress, and a recent Supreme Court verdict that paves the way for a $2 billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to Tehran or its proxies. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has described the decision as “flagrant theft” and evidence of enduring American hostility toward Tehran.

Tehran’s narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies: the revolution’s power brokers, steeped in official narratives of American treachery; an Iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend; and a European business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative market.

And it wouldn’t be the first time Tehran got cold feet about its nuclear obligations out of an unfortunate sense of that the payoff was insufficient. In 2005, two years after a deal with Britain, France, and Germany to suspend core aspects of its nuclear program, Iran’s leadership soured on that deal and reneged. Anxiety about a repeat performance is prompting new U.S. efforts to facilitate business in Iran and a mounting debate in the press and on Capitol Hill around additional American sanctions relief.

But Iran’s campaign is grounded in a fundamental falsehood: that Washington has failed to live up to its end of the bargain. In fact, Washington has delivered fully on the sanctions relief pledged under the JCPOA, and officials in the White House, State Department, and even the enforcement office of the Treasury Department have engaged in extraordinary outreach to clarify remaining restrictions and underscore American commitment to the terms of the deal.

Moreover, the rewards of Iran’s nuclear concessions are actually widely evident—in the volume of new trade and investment that is already underway; in the scope and velocity of diplomatic and commercial reengagement with Iran; in the swifter-than-anticipated revival of oil exports. Heads of state from Italy and India, from South Korea to South Africa are beating a path to Tehran, accompanied by contingents of eager investors. Meanwhile, Iranian officials including Seif—chief of the same Central Bank that was formerly barred by sanctions—headline swanky conferences aimed at wooing European business players. The great Iranian gold rush is on.

The catch is that the money is moving more slowly than Iranian officials seem to have anticipated—and the trickle-down effect has been almost nonexistent for the average Iranian. The explanation for this lag is complex and multi-dimensional.

First and foremost, Iran is hard hit by the decline in oil prices, which have fallen by roughly 60 percent since the interim nuclear deal was signed in November 2013. Even in the best of times, the Islamic Republic was never a particularly easy place to do business, and many of its structural economic problems have been exacerbated by a decade of sanctions and the particularly egregious mismanagement of the 2005 to 2013 tenure of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Iran’s designation since 2008 as a “high-risk and non-cooperative” jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force, a multilateral body established to combat money laundering and terrorist finance, poses additional hurdles for banks. In addition, a host of other market distortions induce investor caution: corruption, a bloated and opaque banking system, an inflexible labor market, unattractive contract terms for energy investments, the traditional dominance of the public sector.

Tehran’s challenges in luring capital is further complicated by its reputation for provocative domestic and regional behavior. Torching embassies, arresting tourists and dual-national businessmen, testing ballistic missiles—none of this provides a conducive context for Iran’s reintegration into the global economy. As the old adage goes, capital is a coward, and the Islamic Republic is a haunted house.

Iran has seen this all before. Similar factors undercut Tehran’s previous efforts to open up to the global economy. In the early 1990s, after the long war with Iraq, then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani sought foreign trade and investment as part of his massive reconstruction program. Initial outcomes were encouraging, but falling oil prices, excessive short-term debt, and the perpetuation of an ideological foreign policy drove away investors and undermined his economic reforms.

This time around, American sanctions have cast a long shadow. The nuclear deal left intact an array of restrictions: the primary U.S. embargo on Iran as well as financial measures that preclude access to the U.S. dollar and penalize third countries for doing business with Iranian individuals and entities that are involved with terrorism or other malfeasance. The vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor. And the hangover effect of a decade of stringent (and costly) enforcement has generated a culture of overcompliance in the international financial sector, since institutional due diligence is an integral dimension of the industry’s viability.

None of this should come as a surprise to Tehran; American officials were crystal clear throughout the negotiations and in advocating on behalf of the deal that the deal only removed the nuclear-related sanctions and that U.S. measures imposed as a result of Iran’s support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or other issues would remain intact. And every sensible analyst looked past the inflated rhetoric of the deal’s opponents, who brayed against the deal as a massive “cash bonanza,” to recognize that the residual sanctions regime would remain a significant factor in Iran’s post-deal economic picture. As I wrote at the time:

So if this was entirely predictable, why is Tehran crying foul now? Unlike in the United States—where the agreement’s shortcomings were oversold (if anything) rather than downplayed—in Iran there was a triumphalism with which the deal was sold domestically. This was mostly because of the peculiarities of Iran’s political system. To avoid the appearance of contravening the “red lines” articulated by Khamenei, the country’s ultimate authority, Iranian negotiators depicted the JCPOA as delivering wholesale sanctions relief. Rouhani described the outcome as a “legal, technical, and political victory” for the country, emphasizing that Tehran achieved “more than what was imagined.”

Iran’s politically motivated embellishments were exacerbated by the hype surrounding the deal, cultivated by entrepreneurs and aspiring middlemen who presented Iran in hyperbolic terms as “the best emerging market for years to come” and “one of the hottest opportunities of the decade.” But while it may offend the Iranian ego, the relative scale of the opportunity in Iran is more modest than other much-heralded economic openings, such as China. It is hardly inconceivable that many banks and other firms have simply chosen to sit this first round out.

Neither Iran’s economic challenges nor the grievances of its leadership are “fraying” the nuclear accord; in fact, they only highlight its underlying logic. While the deal’s scope was finite—it was not a wholesale rapprochement or rehabilitation—many of its supporters argued that its logic would prove self-reinforcing. Iran’s gradual reintegration into the global economy would bolster the case among its leadership for a broader moderation of its domestic and foreign policies precisely in order to boost their benefits.

Tehran’s dissatisfaction with the payout to date suggests this formula is working. A little bit of sanctions relief has whetted the entrepreneurial appetites of the clerical state. Despite official invocations proclaiming a “resistance economy,” the trickle of new trade and investment from Europe and Asia into Iran since the deal was signed has only intensified pressure for more—and for more tangible dissemination of its benefits among the Iranian population. In other words, it is the success of the nuclear deal—rather than its shortcomings—that is driving the complaints that have emanated from Iran.

The United States is not responsible for the hesitancy of international capital and other economic hiccups that Tehran has experienced in the aftermath of the nuclear agreement. The culpability resides, as it always has, with Iran and the risks that its government’s policies pose for international business. If Iranians want to see their nascent opening to the international community expanded—if they want the peace dividend they have been promised, they need to look to their own leadership and its policies. If Iran’s Central Bank governor wants “normal conditions” and “access to the U.S. financial system,” as he demanded during his Washington visit, let him return to Tehran and help instill the kind of reforms that would make those goals possible.

There are sensible steps that Washington can take to ensure that the provisions of the nuclear deal are fully feasible, including limited mechanisms for enabling transactions, such as the repatriation of previously frozen assets, that are specifically permitted under the deal. Such exceptional measures are reasonable—not because they help Tehran, but because they help sustain consensus between Washington and its European partners and help preserve the West’s negotiating leverage with any future targets of American or multilateral financial sanctions.

However, it would be profoundly detrimental for Washington to provide significant unilateral relief to Tehran without reciprocal additional Iranian concessions. And the PR blitz by senior U.S. officials to reassure Iran’s prospective foreign investors has taken on an unseemly tone, especially since existing sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from facilitating transactions with Iran by foreign entities.

These measures may be aimed at building confidence, but they ultimately have the opposite effect—eroding Iran’s incentives to abide by the deal, undermining any rationale for broader changes. Iran remains a risky place to do business, and it is in Washington’s interests—as well as those of Iranians and the broader international community—that Tehran focuses on mitigating those risks rather than seeking to subvert their penalties.

The nuclear deal is working; Iran’s nascent reintegration into the global economy is intensifying internal debates and popular expectations. This is all to the good. But to get more, Tehran will have to give more.",REAL,are the wheels coming off the iran deal less than a year after iran america and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord a debate over its terms has erupted anew in washington the braggadocio of a prominent white house aide is fueling republican accusations that president obama deliberately deceived the congress and the country about iran and the deal and in tehran frustration over the residual impact of american sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from iranian leaders that the united states has failed to live up to its end of the bargain as a result some are fretting that the deal is at risk and are laying blame on the white house doorstep both claims are spurious and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the obama administration in the end however the ruckus over recent comments by deputy national security advisor ben rhodes is largely an insidethebeltway dramaone that provides endless entertainment for washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or american diplomacy by contrast irans dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for washington but it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is unraveling rather the chorus of complaints from tehran demonstrates the accord signed in july  is working exactly as it was intendedforestalling iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economy obamas handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility for the sake of the deal and for any prospect of a durable thermidor for the revolutionary state washington should resist the temptation to assuage irans postdeal growing pains if iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield thatin other words meaningful political economic and foreign policy reform not surprisingly iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from washington their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed on an april visit to washington valiollah seif the head of irans central bank questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement insisting that tehran has received almost nothing of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal formally called the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa mohammad javad zarif the countrys smoothspoken foreign minister has contended that the united states needs to do way more warning that if one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falter and irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei charged recently that the americans are engaged in obstruction and deception adding on paper the americans say banks can trade with iran but in practice they act in such an iranophobic way that no trade can take place with iran adding fuel to the fire are changes to us visa policies that are perceived at constraining irans economic rebound deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the us congress and a recent supreme court verdict that paves the way for a  billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to tehran or its proxies iranian president hassan rouhani has described the decision as flagrant theft and evidence of enduring american hostility toward tehran tehrans narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies the revolutions power brokers steeped in official narratives of american treachery an iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend and a european business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative market and it wouldnt be the first time tehran got cold feet about its nuclear obligations out of an unfortunate sense of that the payoff was insufficient in  two years after a deal with britain france and germany to suspend core aspects of its nuclear program irans leadership soured on that deal and reneged anxiety about a repeat performance is prompting new us efforts to facilitate business in iran and a mounting debate in the press and on capitol hill around additional american sanctions relief but irans campaign is grounded in a fundamental falsehood that washington has failed to live up to its end of the bargain in fact washington has delivered fully on the sanctions relief pledged under the jcpoa and officials in the white house state department and even the enforcement office of the treasury department have engaged in extraordinary outreach to clarify remaining restrictions and underscore american commitment to the terms of the deal moreover the rewards of irans nuclear concessions are actually widely evidentin the volume of new trade and investment that is already underway in the scope and velocity of diplomatic and commercial reengagement with iran in the swifterthananticipated revival of oil exports heads of state from italy and india from south korea to south africa are beating a path to tehran accompanied by contingents of eager investors meanwhile iranian officials including seifchief of the same central bank that was formerly barred by sanctionsheadline swanky conferences aimed at wooing european business players the great iranian gold rush is on the catch is that the money is moving more slowly than iranian officials seem to have anticipatedand the trickledown effect has been almost nonexistent for the average iranian the explanation for this lag is complex and multidimensional first and foremost iran is hard hit by the decline in oil prices which have fallen by roughly  percent since the interim nuclear deal was signed in november  even in the best of times the islamic republic was never a particularly easy place to do business and many of its structural economic problems have been exacerbated by a decade of sanctions and the particularly egregious mismanagement of the  to  tenure of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad irans designation since  as a highrisk and noncooperative jurisdiction by financial action task force a multilateral body established to combat money laundering and terrorist finance poses additional hurdles for banks in addition a host of other market distortions induce investor caution corruption a bloated and opaque banking system an inflexible labor market unattractive contract terms for energy investments the traditional dominance of the public sector tehrans challenges in luring capital is further complicated by its reputation for provocative domestic and regional behavior torching embassies arresting tourists and dualnational businessmen testing ballistic missilesnone of this provides a conducive context for irans reintegration into the global economy as the old adage goes capital is a coward and the islamic republic is a haunted house iran has seen this all before similar factors undercut tehrans previous efforts to open up to the global economy in the early s after the long war with iraq thenpresident ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani sought foreign trade and investment as part of his massive reconstruction program initial outcomes were encouraging but falling oil prices excessive shortterm debt and the perpetuation of an ideological foreign policy drove away investors and undermined his economic reforms this time around american sanctions have cast a long shadow the nuclear deal left intact an array of restrictions the primary us embargo on iran as well as financial measures that preclude access to the us dollar and penalize third countries for doing business with iranian individuals and entities that are involved with terrorism or other malfeasance the vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor and the hangover effect of a decade of stringent and costly enforcement has generated a culture of overcompliance in the international financial sector since institutional due diligence is an integral dimension of the industrys viability none of this should come as a surprise to tehran american officials were crystal clear throughout the negotiations and in advocating on behalf of the deal that the deal only removed the nuclearrelated sanctions and that us measures imposed as a result of irans support for terrorism its human rights abuses or other issues would remain intact and every sensible analyst looked past the inflated rhetoric of the deals opponents who brayed against the deal as a massive cash bonanza to recognize that the residual sanctions regime would remain a significant factor in irans postdeal economic picture as i wrote at the time so if this was entirely predictable why is tehran crying foul now unlike in the united stateswhere the agreements shortcomings were oversold if anything rather than downplayedin iran there was a triumphalism with which the deal was sold domestically this was mostly because of the peculiarities of irans political system to avoid the appearance of contravening the red lines articulated by khamenei the countrys ultimate authority iranian negotiators depicted the jcpoa as delivering wholesale sanctions relief rouhani described the outcome as a legal technical and political victory for the country emphasizing that tehran achieved more than what was imagined irans politically motivated embellishments were exacerbated by the hype surrounding the deal cultivated by entrepreneurs and aspiring middlemen who presented iran in hyperbolic terms as the best emerging market for years to come and one of the hottest opportunities of the decade but while it may offend the iranian ego the relative scale of the opportunity in iran is more modest than other muchheralded economic openings such as china it is hardly inconceivable that many banks and other firms have simply chosen to sit this first round out neither irans economic challenges nor the grievances of its leadership are fraying the nuclear accord in fact they only highlight its underlying logic while

8357.0,Saturn’s Baffling Hexagon — The Raging Storm Four Times the Size of Earth has Changed Its Colors,"NASA’s Cassini spacecraft discovered a static hexagonal storm four times the size of Earth crowning Saturn’s north pole, including a clearly defined eyewall. Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it’s a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the center of the planet’s north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades – maybe even centuries.
Each side on the northern polar hexagon is approximately 13,800 km long, and the whole structure rotates once every 10 hours and 39 minutes -a day on Saturn. In just four years, Saturn’s hexagon has changed its color from blue to gold when Saturn’s north pole gears up for next year’s summer solstice.Saturn’s hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet’s dense atmosphere. Because Saturn does not have land masses or oceans on its surface to complicate weather the way Earth does, its conditions should give scientists a more elementary model to study the physics of circulation patterns and atmosphere, said Kevin Baines, an atmospheric scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who has studied the hexagon with Cassini’s visual and infrared mapping spectrometer. The last visible-light images of the entire hexagon were captured by NASA’s Voyager spacecraft nearly 30 years ago, the last time spring began on Saturn. After the sunlight faded, darkness shrouded the north pole for 15 years. Much to the delight and bafflement of Cassini scientists, the location and shape of the hexagon in the latest images match up with what they saw in the Voyager pictures.
“The longevity of the hexagon makes this something special, given that weather on Earth lasts on the order of weeks,” said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology. “It’s a mystery on par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long-lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter.”
The hexagon was originally discovered in images taken by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1980s. It encircles Saturn at about 77 degrees north latitude and has been estimated to have a diameter wider than two Earths. The jet stream is believed to whip along the hexagon at around 100 meters per second (220 miles per hour).
Early hexagon images from Voyager and ground-based telescopes suffered from poor viewing perspectives. Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, has a better angle for viewing the north pole. But the long darkness of Saturnian winter hid the hexagon from Cassini’s visible-light cameras for years. Infrared instruments, however, were able to obtain images by using heat patterns. Those images showed the hexagon is nearly stationary and extends deep into the atmosphere. They also discovered a hotspot and cyclone in the same region.
As observed by NASA’s Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its center at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph).
While we’re pretty confident that we know what Saturn’s hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it’s relatively easy to keep it spinning – but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain.
It’s fascinating that the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colors in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016:

The best hypothesis is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze.
“The color change is thought to be an effect of Saturn’s seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017.”
“Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,” Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. “The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth’s Antarctic ozone hole.”
But since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 – the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn’s equator – it’s been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight, which means that for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month.
“Other effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role,” NASA explained this week. “Scientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions.”
NASA scientists have an investigation underway to figure out what’s actually going.

Deposed chairman of Tata Group, Cyrus Mistry, has hit upon a great idea to get back his job. At a press conference earlier in the day, Mistry announced that he shall no longer be known as Cyrus Mistry, and instead asked everyone to call him Rohit Sharma-Mistry. 
Fifteen minutes after Sharma-Mistry’s press conference, Ratan Rata called for a press conference and announced the group’s decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Group. 
“Mr. Sharma-Mistry is a rare talent who will be groomed for the future,” said Tata. “The Trustees and other directors of Tata Sons are convinced about Mr. Sharma-Mistry’s ability and firmly believe that when he gets going, he can turn around any business within one quarter.” 
Later, our correspondent reached out to the jubilant Sharma-Mistry and asked him what gave him this idea. Sharma-Mistry said that the emotional atyachar at Tata Sons was irking him, but then he met an inspired god man from Chennai, Cheeni Mama, who gave him guidance. 
Mr Sharma-Mistry is now considering building a temple for Cheeni Mama. “After all, our organization is known for its charitable acts, and in TN it is accepted practice to build a temple for actors, so this is very well in line with our organizational ethos,” Sharma-Mistry was quoted as saying.

8322.0,The FBI intervenes in the 2016 election,"License DMCA 
In an extraordinary and unprecedented action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before Election Day, sending a letter to Congress announcing new ""investigative steps"" related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. 
The three-paragraph letter by FBI Director James Comey to eight congressional committees on Friday is remarkably vague. It states that ""in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation"" of Clinton's personal email server, which, Comey notes, he had previously told Congress was ""completed."" 
He states that he has agreed to ""allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" He acknowledges that the FBI ""cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant."" 
The obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election. 
Following the report of Comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former Representative Anthony Weiner. - Advertisement - 
Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public. 
Comey's letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate. 
Clinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening, demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. In response to questions, she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. 
It is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. However, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. 
This direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state. The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and anti-establishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. - Advertisement - 
It has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates -- the fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. 
The entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of Washington's war for regime change in Syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-Chinese ""pivot to Asia,"" the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist ""allies"" in Europe, particularly Germany. 
The convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. 
Whether the intention of Comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.",FAKE,license dmca in an extraordinary and unprecedented action the

6212.0,"Re: If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office","Archives Michael On Television If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office By Michael Snyder, on November 1st, 2016 
A couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory , but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don’t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn’t look good for Trump at the time, but now that the FBI has renewed their investigation into Hillary Clinton’s emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump’s favor . 
As I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. 
And as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. 
So we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. 
Donald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. 
And if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. 
Of course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. 
So that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. 
And this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. 
These amazing “coincidences” were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. 
I just thought that this information was “interesting” and so I thought that I would share it. 
Someone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.” 
Beck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that “magic exists”, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points … 
“Let’s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,” Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . “He should win by 5 points.” 
Beck later added: “How can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can’t. Can’t.” 
The conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation “the greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America” and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof “magic exists.” 
Hopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. 
She is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can’t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. 
And the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton “fixer” Cheryl Mills that they were “going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later” … 
It was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice . 
Back in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn’t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. 
But in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. 
The Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. 
I believe that this election is America’s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. 
If the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don’t think that anyone will be able to say that we don’t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. 
The time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. 
If that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation.",FAKE,archives michael on television if donald trump wins he will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office by michael snyder on november st  a couple of weeks ago it

The Obamas refused to be photographed welcoming President-Elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania to the White House Thursday morning, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal .
“The Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House. In his first visit to the White House after the 2008 election, Mr. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama posed for the cameras alongside President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush. The decision not to participate in this tradition illustrates how bitter the campaign was, particularly for Mrs. Obama who delivered some of the most emotional arguments against electing Mr. Trump.”
Fox News reported that there was no pool video of Trump’s arrival due to an unspecified problem. There does not appear to be any photographs published yet of Trump’s arrival to the White House.

As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton .

You wouldn’t know it by watching the news, but there are actually important things going on in the world that have nothing to do with the Presidential election. Today, we’ll talk about some of these non-election-related events on Survival Saturday, like the Dakota access pipeline, Russia, Venezuela, and our dystopian future. 
For election coverage, go on over to my other website, DaisyLuther.com , which is all Hillary, all the time, right up until the election. (My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling.) The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement 
Have you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain? They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government. ( Here are the important things to know about the protest . Trust me, you’ll want to read this.) 
Everyone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September. 
“The federal government ordered a halt to work on a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday, handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the project… 
…The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldn’t authorize construction near Lake Oahe, a culturally important location to the tribe, until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act.” ( source ) 
Unfortunately, the government’s willingness to do the right thing was short-lived. Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose – but not by who you might think. Protestors have been non-violent, but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal. They’ve beaten up on young people, old people, and independent journalists covering the story. Hundreds have been arrested. 
These people are protecting their water sources and their way of life, and they are being brutalized by our own government. The story you’re getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair. 
That couldn’t be further from the truth. The AntiMedia (who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards) has provided truthful coverage, and it is ugly. Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors. Right now, this affects some people up in North Dakota. But what about when someone wants to build something across your land? What about when someone wants to seize your home? What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard? 
Here’s what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . It’s on film. It’s ugly. You owe it to your fellow human beings to witness this and be outraged. Go here to learn what you can do to help . With all of this “progress,” is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete? 
Thousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor. We’ve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital. 
Is this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few? 
I don’t watch a lot of documentaries, but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete . This film is available for free on Amazon , and it isn’t one of those dry, boring ones that keep you shifting in your seat in order to stay awake. It’s fascinating from the moment you hit play. When it was over, we sat there in silence for at least a minute, aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now. 
I can’t recommend this highly enough. Everyone should watch it. Let me quote Morpheus (from the Matrix ) for a moment here. “This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more.” 
This documentary is the red pill. Take it if you want to survive the future that is coming for us all. 
Watch Obsolete then come back over here and let’s talk about it. I think this will spark a very interesting conversation. How will you prepare for a future in which humanity is largely obsolete? Meanwhile in Venezuela… 
Things are still awful there, although there hasn’t been as much news coverage. Basically, this is how life is now for Venezuelans, and recovering from this collapse could take decades. 
Currently, the people of the country are revolting against the unpopular president, Nicholas Maduro. A campaign had begun for a recall election in order to replace Maduro, but authorities halted the process. The electoral council cited fraud when faced with huge numbers of signatures on a petition. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Source: Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images 
NPR reports : 
The demonstrators were protesting “what they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism. The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders, stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press.” 
As for Maduro, he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power, via elections or legal means, ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution : 
“If they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of Congress.” 
What’s more, in a conversation with the American DEA, Maduro’s nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US, which is news to most Americans. Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family. He was caught attempting to smuggle $5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US. The Charlotte Observer reported : 
Efrain Campo…was recorded saying “we’re at war” with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail, according to the transcript, which was filed in federal district court in New York. 
“We need the money,” Campo said, according to the transcript. “Why? Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money. Do you understand? The opposition . . . is getting an infusion of a lot of money.” 
…The defense has sought to paint Campo and his cousin as victims of a U.S. political plot against the Venezuelan government and has asserted that they didn’t have the knowledge or capability to pull off such a complicated transaction. We’re irritating the snot out of Russia… 
Lately, the Powers That Shouldn’t Be (great phrase borrowed from my friend Mel at Truthstream Media ) have been going out of their way to paint Russia and Vladimir Putin as the biggest threat to America. A bigger threat, even, than Hillary Clinton, and boy, that’s a stretch. I’m pretty sure you can put all of these recent headlines together and get a picture of where this is headed. ( Hint .)

5202.0,Blizzard of charges and countercharges melts away as opinions of Trump and Clinton are frozen,"This has turned into the whiplash election, and it’s virtually impossible to keep up with the head-snapping revelations.

Even the most diligent journalist can get vertigo trying to investigate and evaluate each disclosure, which damages Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and spawns dire predictions that their campaign is toast, only to fade in a news cycle or two.

Some developments that in a “normal” election would badly wound a presidential candidate get meager exposure in the rest of the media because they are overshadowed by other mega-stories. No one has the bandwidth to do it all.

This is more than a mere campaign; its craziness has become the beating heart of American culture, debated in every cubicle and coffee shop and at every level of the increasingly toxic stew of social media.

Just look at the last few weeks:

Democrats and many members of the media have taken up weapons and stormed a place called Comey Island.

The FBI director shook up the race by revealing a probe of emails that wound up on the laptop of a top aide’s estranged husband under investigation for sending illicit messages to an underage girl.

The New York Times reported that Trump avoided hundreds of millions of dollars in income taxes through a loophole scheme so dubious his own lawyers advised him that the IRS could declare it improper.

The Clinton campaign got advance questions before CNN town halls from a top Democratic Party official who was also a paid contributor at the network, which booted her.

The Washington Post reported that Donald Trump has repeatedly “sought credit for charity he had not given — or had claimed other people’s giving as his own.”

Back on Comey Island, the FBI chief was reported to have argued that the administration shouldn’t accuse Russia of using cyberwarfare to interfere with the presidential campaign because—yes--it would look partisan so close to the election.

Hacked emails revealed that the daughter of the Democratic nominee’s husband, himself a former president, complained that his aides were cashing in on the Clinton Foundation and siphoning money from her parents.

The Trump Foundation was ordered to stop fundraising by the New York attorney general, a Democrat and Clinton supporter.

Clinton’s top advisers, reeling after the email scandal broke, complained that said she had terrible instincts and a pathological aversion to apologizing, according to hacked emails.

Back on Comey Island, the FBI looked into whether Trump’s company had a secret email server communicating with a Russian bank but found no direct link.

A Clinton aide complained in a hacked email that “we…speak in such a tortured, nuanced way when we don’t get any advantage from the nuance, and just wind up looking political.”

Back on Comey Island, the FBI opened a preliminary investigation of Trump’s former campaign manager and his ties to Russian interests, which Paul Manafort said he knew nothing about.

Trump boasted a decade ago on a Hollywood entertainment show that as a celebrity he could grab women by the genitals, which he now dismisses as locker-room talk.

Back on Comey Island, FBI agents were investigating financial and ethical issues at the Clinton Foundation but were told to stand down by top law-enforcement officials, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Eleven women accused Trump of sexually propositioning them or unwanted kissing or touching, all of which he denounced as lies.

Trump held a news conference before a debate with Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey, who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, and Juanita Broaddrick, who has accused him of rape, which he has denied.

Hillary Clinton nearly collapsed while getting into a car and belatedly revealed that she had pneumonia.

And, well, I could go on.

Many of these cases prompted media firestorms, complete with predictions that Trump or Clinton would be seriously or even fatally damaged. But then the stories were overtaken by some new allegation or outrage.

In the case of Comey’s renewed email investigation, polls so far suggest that it hasn’t moved the needle much beyond the tightening that was already taking place in the race.

It may well be that we’ve all become numb in this whiplash campaign. The race is so polarized, and public attitudes toward Trump and Clinton so firmly established, that each new front-page headline or cable obsession changes few minds.

Perhaps the only consensus is a sense of relief that this long, strange trip is finally coming to an end.

2802.0,Obama Inches Closer to Veto-Proof Support for Iran Nuclear Deal,"Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon said he will vote to support the Iran nuclear deal, a pledge that puts President Barack Obama only three votes short of protecting the pact in Congress.

Merkley issued a statement Sunday calling the accord “the best available strategy to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.”

Merkley’s support brings to 31 the number of senators publicly favoring the deal, which would ease economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on the country’s nuclear program.

Barring defections, Obama needs three more votes from 13 Senate Democrats who have yet to declare their position, to sustain a likely veto of legislation aimed at killing the pact.

If Obama can assemble 41 Senate votes by getting most of the remaining Democrats on board, the Senate may not vote on the agreement at all.

The Republican-controlled Congress has until Sept. 17 to pass a resolution disapproving the deal reached in July between six world powers and Iran. Obama has pledged to veto that resolution if it gets to his desk.

While Republicans have been united in opposing the deal, only two Democratic senators -- Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Democrat in the chamber, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey -- have joined them so far.

Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, plans to announce his decision on Tuesday. Among other Democrats yet to disclose a position are Maryland’s Ben Cardin and New Jersey’s Cory Booker.

The only uncertain Senate Republican vote is that of Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who remains undecided and is expected to make her decision after Sept. 7.

Merkley, in a statement on his website, pledged to vote for the deal even while pointing to “significant shortcomings” that he said the U.S. must address with “a massive intelligence program” and monitoring.

Merkley said he was troubled that the deal allows Iran to import conventional arms after five years and ballistic missile technology after eight years, and sets no restrictions on how Iran can use money it reclaims when sanctions are lifted.

But he rejected a proposal from deal opponents to try to renegotiate the accord for better terms.

If the U.S. rejects the deal and Iran resumes its nuclear program, “the United States would be viewed by the international community as undermining a strong framework for peacefully blocking a potential Iranian bomb,” Merkley said.

While the Republican-controlled House has enough votes to pass a resolution rejecting the deal, it’s unclear whether the Senate does.

6527.0,Shi’ite Militias Join Iraq’s Mosul Attack,"Militia Fighters to Advance on Areas West of City by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This 
After a week and a half of assuring everyone that their role in the invasion of Mosul would be very limited, and removed from the Sunni population, Iraq’s Shi’ite militias have been announced to have launched an offensive west of Mosul, advancing on Tal Afar . 
According to officials, the main goal of this offensive is to cut the city of Mosul off from ISIS territory in Syria, preventing the ISIS fighters within the city from fleeing west if the battle begins to turn sour. The offensive is said to start “within a few days or hours.” 
The involvement of Shi’ite militias in the “liberation” of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. 
An effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the militias’ involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. 
Civilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the militias’ presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing “with” ISIS.

4354.0,‘Super PAC’ Gets Early Start on Pushing for a 2016 Clinton Campaign,"In the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Mitch Stewart devoted himself to defeating Hillary Rodham Clinton, overcoming the advantages of a well-funded Democratic front-runner through grass-roots organizing, and propelling Barack Obama to victory.

On Tuesday, Mr. Stewart and a dozen or so other political operatives and 170 donors will gather in New York to plot how to help Mrs. Clinton win in 2016. The meeting is the first national finance council strategy meeting of Ready for Hillary, a “super PAC” devoted to building a network to support Mrs. Clinton’s potential presidential ambitions.

“We’re coming up with plans on how to engage emerging constituencies that will be incredibly important if there’s a primary and in a general — whether that’s women, African-Americans, Latinos, L.G.B.T.,” said Mr. Stewart, who went on to run Mr. Obama’s battleground-state strategy in 2012.

The all-day meeting at the Parker Meridien hotel will be closed to the news media, but a preview of the day, with panel discussions like “What America Will Look Like in 2016,” about changing demographics, and “Building the Resources to Win,” about developing a campaign infrastructure, provided an early look into what supporters consider Mrs. Clinton’s strengths and potential pitfalls in 2016.

Mrs. Clinton has never had a problem raising money from deep-pocketed donors, but her 2008 campaign lacked the grass-roots enthusiasm and modest Internet donations that buoyed Mr. Obama. Ready for Hillary hopes to build that kind of support.

A grass-roots super PAC may seem an oxymoron: such groups can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on political races as long as they do not coordinate with a candidate. But rather than invest in expensive television ads, Ready for Hillary puts all of its donations into building its email list of supporters.

For every $25,0000 the group raises, it cuts a payment to Rising Tide Interactive, a firm that helps build online lists of supporters. A social media tool on the website will allow supporters to work together to organize to plan rallies and small-dollar fund-raising events. With no candidate and over a year before a potential campaign, Ready for Hillary has roughly a million names on its email list, about half the size of the Hillary for President campaign list at the time Mrs. Clinton suspended her campaign in 2008.

“It’s not our job to be a campaign and it’s not our job to make decisions to tie any potential candidate’s hands,” said Craig T. Smith, an aide in the administration of President Bill Clinton and senior adviser to Ready for Hillary. “The goal is to build a list.”

The strategy is an acknowledgment of mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign, but also a recognition that she cannot simply run as the establishment candidate with inside-the-Beltway support without also inspiring young and minority voters who largely favored Mr. Obama in 2008. Mr. Stewart helped Mr. Obama pick up delegates in small but important caucus states and turn states like Arizona, New Mexico and Virginia into battlegrounds by tapping into changing demographics.

A lineup of longtime Clinton backers and aides will attend Tuesday’s meeting, including Susie Tompkins Buell of San Francisco; Ann Lewis, a former adviser to both Clintons; Jennifer M. Granholm, the former governor of Michigan; and Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist. Along with Ms. Sefl, two young Ready for Hillary volunteers, Taj Magruder, 23, of Philadelphia, and Haley Adams, a student at Yale, will open the event, signaling that the Clinton world intends to bring in fresh voices, even if it means edging some loyal aides out.

The event signals a turning point for Ready for Hillary. The group, registered just before Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in February by young staff members who worked in junior roles on her 2008 campaign, was largely viewed as a makeshift organization that sold Hillary Clinton buttons and iPhone cases online.

Some longtime supporters had worried that the group emerged too soon and that if it were not well run, it could hurt Mrs. Clinton’s prospects, even though she is not involved or in contact with its organizers. But veteran aides like Mr. Smith, Ms. Sefl and Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House, are now signed on as advisers. In recent months, the group has held events in several cities from San Francisco to Houston and has become among the dominant — if not best financed — political action committees on the Democratic side.

The sessions in New York will point to several advantages favoring a Democrat in 2016. “Democrats do have a series of advantages baked into the cake in terms of demographics and the electoral map,” said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded Mark Penn as chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008 campaign.

Fresh off working on behalf of Terry McAuliffe in his successful campaign for governor of Virginia, Mr. Garin will talk about reaching the growing numbers of Hispanics and college-educated white women, and the decline in non-college-educated white male voters, one of the most challenging demographics for Mrs. Clinton. But, he added that some very big odds will work against any Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. “Since World War II, the only time the same party won a third term in the White House was 1988,” Mr. Garin said.

Supporters are also well aware of the attacks Mrs. Clinton would face. During a lunch session, David Brock, founder of Media Matters for America, will lead the “Ready for the Right Wing” tutorial on how to combat conservative attacks and misinformation in the media.

The future of Ready for Hillary is unclear. Should Mrs. Clinton run, the group would most likely dissolve, after encouraging those on its email list to transfer their support to the official Clinton campaign. The widespread belief is that several Ready for Hillary staff members would take up positions on the campaign, which has made the group somewhat of a way station for hopeful aides. If Mrs. Clinton does not run, the group would likely throw its support behind whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.

Either way, this type of early unity and strategizing around a single candidate is a good thing and a rarity in Democratic politics, said Ronald Feldman, a Ready for Hillary national finance council co-chairman who supported John Edwards in 2008.

“We’ve never been paying this much attention this early on, but this time it seemed like a necessity,” Mr. Feldman said.",REAL,in the  presidential primary campaign mitch stewart devoted himself to

in junior roles on her  campaign was largely viewed as a makeshift organization that sold hillary clinton buttons and iphone cases online some longtime supporters had worried that the group emerged too soon and that if it were not well run it could hurt mrs clintons prospects even though she is not involved or in contact with its organizers but veteran aides like mr smith ms sefl and harold ickes a former deputy chief of staff in the clinton white house are now signed on as advisers in recent months the group has held events in several cities from san francisco to houston and has become among the dominant  if not best financed  political action committees on the democratic side the sessions in new york will point to several advantages favoring a democrat in  democrats do have a series of advantages baked into the cake in terms of demographics and the electoral map said geoff garin a pollster who succeeded mark penn as chief strategist for mrs clintons  campaign fresh off working on behalf of terry mcauliffe in his successful campaign for governor of virginia mr garin will talk about reaching the growing numbers of hispanics and collegeeducated white women and the decline in noncollegeeducated white male voters one of the most challenging demographics for mrs clinton but he added that some very big odds will work against any democratic presidential nominee in  since world war ii the only time the same party won a third term in the white house was  mr garin said supporters are also well aware of the attacks mrs clinton would face during a lunch session david brock founder of media matters for america will lead the ready for the right wing tutorial on how to combat conservative attacks and misinformation in the media the future of ready for hillary is unclear should mrs clinton run the group would most likely dissolve after encouraging those on its email list to transfer their support to the official clinton campaign the widespread belief is that several ready for hillary staff members would take up positions on the campaign which has made the group somewhat of a way station for hopeful aides if mrs clinton does not run the group would likely throw its support behind whoever becomes the democratic nominee either way this type of early unity and strategizing around a single candidate is a good thing and a rarity in democratic politics said

3138.0,Christianity under attack: US must do more to promote religious freedom,"Throughout the Middle East and North Africa today, Christianity is under attack.  Terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are destroying some of the oldest and most sacred Christian communities and relics in the world on the very lands where Christianity was born and first took root. They are committing brutal atrocities against Christian communities in Syria and Iraq, persecuting religious minorities and destroying entire towns and local economies. Christians are fleeing their homes in increasing numbers, creating an exploding refugee crisis that will have grave ramifications on the stability and security of the entire region.

While the world has been rightly outraged by the violence waged by ISIS against people of all sects, ethnicities, and religions, the United States, Europe and other key allies have done little to end ISIS’s systematic efforts to drive-out and eradicate entire religious communities from their historic and sacred homelands. The Obama Administration has repeatedly refused to defend religious freedom abroad and continues to ignore its devastating cost to those religious communities targeted by terrorists because of their religious beliefs.

As a nation founded in the pursuit of religious freedom, America can and must do more to root-out the religious intolerance that is helping to foster much of the political instability and violence we see today. Specifically, we believe the Obama Administration should integrate the protection of religious freedom into its overall response to growing terrorist threats and development efforts around the world. Doing so would help to eliminate the underlying causes of violent extremism, promote increased international economic stability, and foster greater respect for human rights.

Promoting religious freedom would, first and foremost, undermine the efforts of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to capitalize on simmering religious intolerance to build influence and wield power. ISIS has succeeded in tearing apart the social fabric of local communities and exacerbating sectarian and ethnic divisions to recruit supporters from disaffected populations and assert control over wide swaths of otherwise insecure territory. As a result, they have precipitated a breakdown of basic order that has allowed new and unprecedented security threats to the United States and our allies to fester and grow.

The Obama administration can counter this strategy by building alliances with popular local and regional leaders who can expose these radical ideologies’ moral bankruptcy and champion pluralism and tolerance. The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests. Only by reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments will we be able to strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups that is bred from deeper political, economic, and social grievances.

Properly designed and implemented, a U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance our national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy across the globe, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women.

Most importantly, it can help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.

Promoting religious freedom would also support the governance structures necessary for economic and political security in developing nations. As recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth. Clearly, sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contributes to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.

Finally, we must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right—a belief that is shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements.

American support for religious liberty sends a potent and unmistakable message to threatened communities around the world: America is your friend. Such support builds enduring good will towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. And it reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.

9447.0,U.S. Taxpayers Pay AT&T Millions of Dollars a Year For the Privilege of Spying on Them,"at 10:41 am 2 Comments 
On Monday, The Daily Beast published a hugely important story about AT&T’s in house, for profit surveillance operation called Project Hemisphere. The program has nothing to do with information sharing legally required under a warrant, but rather consists of a business line through which the telecom giant stores customer data longer than peers in order to turn around and sell it to government agencies (no warrant required). This allows law enforcement to use secret and never disclosed evidence to build a cases against citizens via a shady and unaccountable practice known as parallel construction. 
The article is titled, AT&T Is Spying on Americans for Profit, New Documents Reveal , and is a must read. 
Here are some key excerpts: 
In 2013, Hemisphere was revealed by The New York Times and described only within a Powerpoint presentation made by the Drug Enforcement Administration . The Times described it as a “partnership” between AT&T and the U.S. government; the Justice Department said it was an essential, and prudently deployed, counter-narcotics tool. 
However, AT&T’s own documentation—reported here by The Daily Beast for the first time—shows Hemisphere was used far beyond the war on drugs to include everything from investigations of homicide to Medicaid fraud. 
Hemisphere isn’t a “partnership” but rather a product AT&T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the company’s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public. 
These new revelations come as the company seeks to acquire Time Warner in the face of vocal opposition saying the deal would be bad for consumers . Donald Trump told supporters over the weekend he would kill the acquisition if he’s elected president; Hillary Clinton has urged regulators to scrutinize the deal. 
The fact that this deal is even being considered shows what a giant joke this county has become. 
As I noted on Twitter earlier this week: Why don’t we just merge the entire S&P 500 into one company called Oligarchy Inc. and get it over with. 
— Michael Krieger (@LibertyBlitz) October 24, 2016 
While telecommunications companies are legally obligated to hand over records, AT&T appears to have gone much further to make the enterprise profitable, according to ACLU technology policy analyst Christopher Soghoian. 
AT&T has a unique power to extract information from its metadata because it retains so much of it. The company owns more than three-quarters of U.S. landline switches, and the second largest share of the nation’s wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers, behind Verizon. AT&T retains its cell tower data going back to July 2008, longer than other providers. Verizon holds records for a year and Sprint for 18 months, according to a 2011 retention schedule obtained by The Daily Beast. 
The disclosure of Hemisphere was not the first time AT&T has been caught working with law enforcement above and beyond what the law requires. 
A statement of work from 2014 shows how hush-hush AT&T wants to keep Hemisphere. 
“The Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence,” it says. 
But those charged with a crime are entitled to know the evidence against them come trial. Adam Schwartz, staff attorney for activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that means AT&T leaves investigators no choice but to construct a false investigative narrative to hide how they use Hemisphere if they plan to prosecute anyone. 
Once AT&T provides a lead through Hemisphere, then investigators use routine police work, like getting a court order for a wiretap or following a suspect around, to provide the same evidence for the purpose of prosecution. This is known as “parallel construction.” 
Parallel construction is a pernicious side effect of all this spying. It’s a very important topic I covered last year in the post, How the DEA Uses “Parallel Construction” to Hide Unconstitutional Investigations . 
“This document here is striking,” Schwartz told The Daily Beast. “I’ve seen documents produced by the government regarding Hemisphere, but this is the first time I’ve seen an AT&T document which requires parallel construction in a service to government. It’s very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country.” 
The federal government reimburses municipalities for the expense of Hemisphere through the same grant program that is blamed for police militarization by paying for military gear like Bearcat vehicles. 
There’s your government again. Tirelessly working against you from behind the scenes. 
“At a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it without a warrant. A benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible. Then the judge, the defendant, the general public, the media, and elected officials never know that AT&T and police across America funded by the White House are using the world’s largest metadata database to surveil people,” Schwartz said. 
Sheriff and police departments pay from $100,000 to upward of $1 million a year or more for Hemisphere access. Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, made its inaugural payment to AT&T of $77,924 in 2007, according to a contract reviewed by The Daily Beast. Four years later, the county’s Hemisphere bill had increased more than tenfold to $940,000. 
AT&T documents state law enforcement doesn’t need a search warrant to use Hemisphere, just an administrative subpoena, which does not require probable cause . The DEA was granted administrative subpoena power in 1970. 
Just another reason to end the failed war on drugs and close down the DEA. Recall, unconstitutional surveillance was actually pioneered by the DEA a decade before the 9/11 attacks. See: How NSA Surveillance Was Birthed from the Drug War – The DEA Tracked Billions of Phone Calls Pre 9/11 . 
AT&T stores details for every call, text message, Skype chat, or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure, retaining many records dating back to 1987, according to the Times 2013 Hemisphere report. The scope and length of the collection has accumulated trillions of records and is believed to be larger than any phone record database collected by the NSA under the Patriot Act, the Times reported. 
This summer, I switched my cellphone service away from AT&T and was able to reduce my monthly bill by nearly 50%. You should consider doing the same.

known as parallel construction the article is titled att is spying on americans for profit new documents reveal  and is a must read here are some key excerpts in  hemisphere was revealed by the new york times and described only within a powerpoint presentation made by the drug enforcement administration  the times described it as a partnership between att and the us government the justice department said it was an essential and prudently deployed counternarcotics tool however atts own documentationreported here by the daily beast for the first timeshows hemisphere was used far beyond the war on drugs to include everything from investigations of homicide to medicaid fraud hemisphere isnt a partnership but rather a product att developed marketed and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers no warrant is required to make use of the companys massive trove of data according to att documents only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public these new revelations come as the company seeks to acquire time warner in the face of vocal opposition saying the deal would be bad for consumers  donald trump told supporters over the weekend he would kill the acquisition if hes elected president hillary clinton has urged regulators to scrutinize the deal the fact that this deal is even being considered shows what a giant joke this county has become as i noted on twitter earlier this week why dont we just merge the entire sp  into one company called oligarchy inc and get it over with  michael krieger libertyblitz october   while telecommunications companies are legally obligated to hand over records att appears to have gone much further to make the enterprise profitable according to aclu technology policy analyst christopher soghoian att has a unique power to extract information from its metadata because it retains so much of it the company owns more than threequarters of us landline switches and the second largest share of the nations wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers behind verizon att retains its cell tower data going back to july  longer than other providers verizon holds records for a year and sprint for  months according to a  retention schedule obtained by the daily beast the disclosure of hemisphere was not the first time att has been caught working with law enforcement above and beyond what the law requires a statement of work from  shows how hushhush att wants to keep hemisphere the government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence it says but those charged with a crime are entitled to know the evidence against them come trial adam schwartz staff attorney for activist group electronic frontier foundation said that means att leaves investigators no choice but to construct a false investigative narrative to hide how they use hemisphere if they plan to prosecute anyone once att provides a lead through hemisphere then investigators use routine police work like getting a court order for a wiretap or following a suspect around to provide the same evidence for the purpose of prosecution this is known as parallel construction parallel construction is a pernicious side effect of all this spying its a very important topic i covered last year in the post how the dea uses parallel construction to hide unconstitutional investigations  this document here is striking schwartz told the daily beast ive seen documents produced by the government regarding hemisphere but this is the first time ive seen an att document which requires parallel construction in a service to government its very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country the federal government reimburses municipalities for the expense of hemisphere through the same grant program that is blamed for police militarization by paying for military gear like bearcat vehicles theres your government again tirelessly working against you from behind the scenes at a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it without a warrant a benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible then the judge the defendant the general public the media and elected officials never know that att and police across america funded by the white house are using the worlds largest metadata database to surveil people schwartz said sheriff and police departments pay from  to upward of  million a year or more for hemisphere access harris county texas home to houston made its inaugural payment to att of  in  according to a contract reviewed by the daily beast four years later the countys hemisphere bill had increased more than tenfold to  att documents state law enforcement doesnt need a search warrant to use hemisphere just an administrative subpoena which does not require probable cause  the dea was granted administrative subpoena power in  just another reason to end the failed war on drugs and close down the dea recall unconstitutional surveillance was actually pioneered by the dea a decade before the  attacks see how nsa surveillance was birthed from the drug war  the dea tracked billions of phone calls pre   att stores details for every call text message skype chat or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure retaining many records dating back to  according to the times  hemisphere report the scope and length of the collection has accumulated trillions of records and is believed to be larger than any phone record database collected by the nsa under the patriot act the times reported this summer i switched my

421.0,"Buffett: If I Ran Fed, I Would Not Raise Rates Significantly","""I probably wouldn't do much,"" Buffett said when asked what he would do if he ran the Fed. ""Things are working pretty well, and I would be worried that if I raised rates significantly with negative interest rates in Europe, I would be very worried about what that would do to the flow of funds.""

He also noted that the economy ""is improving month by month.""

Buffett spoke at an automotive industry conference in New York, along with the chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway automotive dealer group, Larry Van Tuyl.

Buffett and Van Tuyl said that Berkshire Hathaway Automotive is actively looking to purchase more dealerships to add to the 81 auto dealerships it now owns in 10 states. Van Tuyl said that the company will look to expand in the United States and not internationally, at least for now.

Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway will price auto dealerships for possible acquisition by using a long-term outlook and not allow short-term swings of the U.S. auto market to affect purchase decisions.

He also said those purchase decisions will not be related to changes in interest rates.

""If (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen came up and whispered in my ear what she was going to do for the next two years, it wouldn't make any difference what we do. If we got a chance to buy a dealership at a sensible price with the right people, we'd buy it. We'd buy it in five minutes.""

Buffett and Van Tuyl both said that while Tesla Motors Inc. has a model of selling cars directly to consumers, the volume is too low to affect the U.S. auto distribution system.

""Usually when a distribution system becomes that firmly established, there is a reason for it. I just don't see that changing,"" said Buffett.

He said that self-driving cars will ""be a reality"" but that he expects autonomous cars to be less than 10 percent of the auto market by 2030.

Earlier Tuesday, at the same National Automobile Dealers Association-J.D. Power conference in New York, Buffett said a Greek exit could be constructive for the eurozone.",REAL,i probably wouldnt do much buffett said when asked what he would do if he ran the fed things are working pretty well and i would be worried that if i raised rates significantly with negative interest rates in europe i would be very worried about what that would do to the flow of funds he also noted that the economy is improving month by month buffett spoke at an automotive industry conference in new york along with the chairman of the berkshire hathaway automotive dealer group larry van tuyl buffett and van tuyl said that berkshire hathaway automotive is actively looking to purchase more dealerships to add to the  auto dealerships it now owns in  states van tuyl said that the company will look to expand in the united states and not internationally at least for now buffett said that berkshire hathaway will price auto dealerships for possible acquisition by using a longterm outlook and not allow shortterm swings of the us auto market to affect purchase decisions he also said those purchase decisions will not be related to changes in interest rates if federal reserve chair janet yellen came up and whispered in my ear what she was going to do for the next two years it wouldnt make any difference what we do if we got a chance to buy a dealership at a sensible price with the right people wed buy it wed buy it in five minutes buffett and van tuyl both said that while tesla motors inc has a model of selling cars directly to consumers the volume is too low to affect the us auto distribution system usually when a distribution system becomes that firmly established there is a reason for it i just dont see that changing said buffett he said that selfdriving cars will be a reality but that he expects autonomous cars to be less than  percent of the auto market by  earlier tuesday at the same national automobile dealers associationjd power conference in new york buffett said a greek exit could be constructive for the eurozone,"['probably', 'wouldnt', 'much', 'buffett', 'said', 'asked', 'would', 'ran', 'fed', 'things', 'working', 'pretty', 'well', 'would', 'worried', 'raised', 'rates', 'significantly', 'negative', 'interest', 'rates', 'europe', 'would', 'worried', 'would', 'flow', 'funds', 'also', 'noted', 'economy', 'improving', 'month', 'month', 'buffett', 'spoke', 'automotive', 'industry', 'conference', 'new', 'york', 'along', 'chairman', 'berkshire', 'hathaway', 'automotive', 'dealer', 'group', 'larry', 'van', 'tuyl', 'buffett', 'van', 'tuyl', 'said', 'berkshire', 'hathaway', 'automotive', 'actively', 'looking', 'purchase', 'dealerships', 'add', 'auto', 'dealerships', 'owns', 'states', 'van', 'tuyl', 'said', 'company', 'look', 'expand', 'united', 'states', 'internationally', 'least', 'buffett', 'said', 'berkshire', 'hathaway', 'price', 'auto', 'dealerships', 'possible', 'acquisition', 'using', 'longterm', 'outlook', 'allow', 'shortterm', 'swings', 'us', 'auto', 'market', 'affect', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'also', 'said', 'purchase', 'decisions', 'related', 'changes', 'interest', 'rates', 'federal', 'reserve', 'chair', 'janet', 'yellen', 'came', 'whispered', 'ear', 'going', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'wouldnt', 'make', 'difference', 'got', 'chance', 'buy', 'dealership', 'sensible', 'price', 'right', 'people', 'wed', 'buy', 'wed', 'buy', 'five', 'minutes', 'buffett', 'van', 'tuyl', 'said', 'tesla', 'motors', 'inc', 'model', 'selling', 'cars', 'directly', 'consumers', 'volume', 'low', 'affect', 'us', 'auto', 'distribution', 'system', 'usually', 'distribution', 'system', 'becomes', 'firmly', 'established', 'reason', 'dont', 'see', 'changing', 'said', 'buffett', 'said', 'selfdriving', 'cars', 'reality', 'expects', 'autonomous', 'cars', 'less', 'percent', 'auto', 'market', 'earlier', 'tuesday', 'national', 'automobile', 'dealers', 'associationjd', 'power', 'conference', 'new', 'york', 'buffett', 'said', 'greek', 'exit', 'could', 'constructive', 'eurozone']","['ORG', 'LOC', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'TIME', 'PERSON', 'ORG', 'GPE', 'PERCENT', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'NORP']","{'GPE': 5, 'DATE': 3, 'PERSON': 3, 'ORG': 2, 'LOC': 1, 'TIME': 1, 'PERCENT': 1, 'NORP': 1}",2,3,5,347,0.0731931112365895,69
7228.0,Are Tensions With Russia Even Real?,"10-26-16 In September 2015, at the behest of its legitimate government, Russia began aerial operations to combat ISIS and al-Nusra terrorists in Syria. Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as moderate rebels when none exist - supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.Theyre massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers? Why does it pretend moderate fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent moderates from terrorist groups its combating when all anti-government forces are the same?Why isnt it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? Its the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing - supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause - a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, its letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces its sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement:The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume humanitarian pauses in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo - or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their guarantees if made?Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution - a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies cant imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured.The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them - not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks.Washington is delighted with Moscows ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying:We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful than it has been thus far - meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

2850.0,Iran agrees to nuclear restrictions in framework deal with world powers,"Iran agreed in principle to accept significant restrictions on its nuclear facilities for at least a decade and submit to international inspections under a framework deal announced Thursday after months of contentious negotiations with the United States and other world powers.

In return, international sanctions that have battered Iran’s economy would be lifted in phases if it meets its commitments, meaning it could take a year or less for relief from the penalties to kick in.

The framework agreement, a milestone in negotiations that began 12 years ago, is not a final deal. But it creates parameters for three more months of negotiations over technical details and some matters that remain unresolved. Any one of those issues could doom a comprehensive agreement. Among them is the pace at which sanctions will be suspended.

“The political understanding with details that we have reached is a solid foundation for the good deal we are seeking,” said Secretary of State John F. Kerry, sounding hoarse after an all-night negotiation session.

The key moments in the long history of U.S.-Iran tensions

The agreement includes almost all the restrictions on Iran’s nuclear facilities, laboratories, mines and mills that the United States had sought in recent months, although it initially aimed for even tougher restrictions.

But Iran would get several benefits that may make the deal more palatable to politicians and the public in Tehran. It would not have to close any of its three nuclear facilities, though it would be left with only one that would enrich uranium — at levels low enough to create fuel for power plants but not high enough to create weapons-grade material.

The limitations would produce a one-year “breakout” period, meaning it would take Iran a full year to build up enough material to build one nuclear warhead, compared with current estimates of two to three months, officials said.

Many sanctions initially would be suspended, rather than lifted permanently as Iran sought, so they could be “snapped back” into place if Iran was discovered to be cheating, the officials said.

Iran’s apparent acceptance of so many conditions sought by the United States could give the Obama administration a tool to fend off critics in Congress who want to impose new sanctions to wring more concessions from the Iranians.

The White House fears such steps could scuttle the talks and prompt Tehran to resume its nuclear program at full tilt. Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian uses.

While the negotiations will continue through June, much of the attention will now shift to the White House and its defense of the negotiations, both in classified briefings to Congress and in public arenas.

Obama hailed the agreement as a “historic understanding” and asked whether anyone really thinks that the deal is “a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a persistent critic of the negotiations, told Obama by telephone that a final deal based on the parameters announced Thursday “would threaten the survival of Israel,” according to an Israeli statement.

Kerry’s predecessor at the State Department, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called the framework agreement an “understanding,” saying it was an “important step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel, and the region.”

The announcement of the agreement was made by weary-looking diplomats from Iran, the European Union, the United States and five other nations. Most had slept only one or two hours after the previous day’s talks, which stretched nearly through the night.

They sounded exuberant even before they arrived at a Lausanne school a few miles from the hotel where the last rounds of talks had been held. Many diplomats had been cautious after the negotiations failed to meet a March 31 deadline. But once the bargaining ended Thursday, there was a flurry of excited tweets.

“Big day,” wrote Kerry, who shouldered most of the direct negotiations with Iran.

Once the agreement was reached, the diplomats walked onto a stage bearing the flags of the nations involved in the talks — Iran, Germany, France, Britain, Russia, China and the United States.

Then Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister and chief negotiator in the talks, and the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, made statements.

Mogherini said Iran and the world powers were taking a “decisive step” before she listed the main parameters for an eventual deal in which Iran would be permitted to pursue the civilian use of nuclear technology.

[A step-by-step guide to what the Iran agreement actually means]

Under the agreement, Iran’s heavy-water reactor in Arak would be rebuilt so it could not produce weapons-grade plutonium. No nuclear fuel would be reprocessed, and spent fuel would be exported or diluted.

Iran’s underground plant at Fordow would be converted from a uranium-enrichment site into a nuclear physics and technology center. The site was built secretly deep inside a mountain near Qom and would be difficult to destroy by military attack.

As Mogherini was speaking, the State Department was

e-mailing reporters a “fact sheet” outlining more details that it said Iran had agreed to, though it could not immediately be confirmed that Iran was indeed on board with every item.

In one of the most significant points, the number of Iran’s centrifuges would be cut by two-thirds, to about 6,000, according to the statement. It said they would be first-generation machines, not the more advanced ones that Iran has sought. Keeping the old centrifuges is a key element in establishing the one-year breakout period, a red line for Washington.

The fact sheet said Iran further agreed not to enrich uranium above the level of 3.67 percent for at least 15 years. That level of low-enriched uranium is suitable as fuel for nuclear power plants but not as fissile material for nuclear weapons, which require uranium enriched to about 90 percent purity.

Iran has agreed to reduce its stockpile of about 10,000 kilograms (22,000 pounds) of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) for 15 years, the fact sheet said.

The restrictions would be monitored through inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and some of them would last 25 years under the accord.

Zarif seemed to go out of his way to thank Kerry for investing so much time and effort in the negotiations, which he said had been conducted with “mutual respect.”

The preliminary agreement could foretell the beginning of a new chapter in Iran’s relationship with the world, and particularly the United States.

Though six nations negotiated with Iran, much of the heavy lifting was done in meetings between the United States and Iran. The countries have been hostile toward each other for decades, particularly since the 1979 revolution and the seizure of dozens of American diplomats who were held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

But the United States and Iran will remain at odds on many issues.

“We have serious differences with the United States,” Zarif said. “We have built mutual distrust in the past. . . . So what I hope is that through courageous implementation of this, some of that trust could be remedied. But that is for us all to wait and see.”

7628.0,Comment on This Is What Constipation Does To Your Body by THIS IS WHAT CONSTIPATION DOES TO YOUR BODY | TheHealthology,"  Big pharmaceutical companies don’t want you to know that some of the artificial medication for constipation significantly reduce the effectiveness of the intestines. As a result, some people report that without taking certain medication, they can’t visit the toilet. The good news is, you can solve constipation quite easily. But let’s delve deeply into what constipation can do to the body first. Bad Breath Firstly, constipation can cause bad breath (halitosis). Unfortunately, people who suffer from bad breath don’t always realize that they have a problem. People are unlikely to point out to a person that their breath stinks; therefore, they might miss out on social events and job opportunities due to bad breath. Constipation can cause bad breath because there is a build up of toxic waste and the gasses rise up through the body. Rectal Issues & Infection As stools spend more time in the bowels, water is reabsorbed. As a result, stools get hard and dry. Some constipation suffers report that passing bowels becomes very painful and can take many hours. As a result, the rectum is stretched beyond its limits. This can lead to rectal prolapse, which is a rectum which fails to close. Rectal prolapse sufferers usually wear diapers because stool leaks out of them. Moreover, they are more prone to infection. Increase Toxins The skin is the largest organ in the body and is a reflection of a person’s general health. Constipation typically increases the buildup of toxins in the body. As a result, the skin has to work harder to eliminate toxins. This can cause acne, skin discoloration etc. Therefore, if your skin is bad, don’t buy an expensive beauty product. Take a look at your diet, and whether you suffer from constipation. The skin is a reflection of inner health.   Colon Cancer Constipation can also cause colon cancer. The colon is designed to hold a few pounds of stools. Think of it like a plastic bag. Overload with heavy items and it rips. It’s primary function is to transport stool. However, when an individual is constipated, it has to store stool. This puts a strain on the inner membrane and can cause ruptures and internal infections. Invasive surgery may be required in such instances. Loss Of Healthy Bacteria The intestines contain flora (healthy bacteria) which help with immunity and vitamin production. Constipation reduces the concentration of flora, thereby leaving sufferers more susceptible to infection and illness. Moreover, they help to keep stools soft. Therefore, constipation sufferers can go through a downward spiral whereby their condition worsens over time. As people age, they are more likely to get constipated. Moreover, it is more likely to have a serious effect on their health. This is because the body isn’t as resilient. Notably, constipation can have a big effect on quality of life; especially if it comes with one of the serious conditions above. Fortunately, there is a natural cure. Sufferers no longer have to be on a path to deteriorating health. What You Can Do A majority of constipation medication are filled with chemicals which can harm the body, and make constipation worse. Even a product like Metamucil contains ingredients no person should consume, like aspartame. Change your diet! This is one of the best ways to end constipation. Eat plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables and cut out processed foods as much as you can. Eating rancid fats (cooked meat) also doesn’t help with constipation and your digestive system so limiting that as much as possible is important. There are also some great products on the market that can assist you in ending constipation while you spend time changing your diet over time. Wholey Shit is a great example as it contains only a few natural, high quality ingredients -and it works great! You can get a free sample of Wholey Shit here.

8918.0,Fifteen Quotes Proving False Flag Terrorism & the Existence of a ‘Shadow Government’,"ARJUN WALIA OCTOBER 18, 2016 Tensions between the United States, their allies, and Russia continue to rise. It seems, as always, that we are on the brink of global war. The Western military industrial complex continues to take over the Middle East and arm ISIS and other terrorist groups, as well as establish and solidify their military presence throughout the world. The sheer number of United States military bases around the globe is astonishing. 
For more, unbiased information on the current state of affairs between the United States and Russia, I recommend visiting theantimedia.org. 
Mainstream media outlets continue to spread propaganda , and have been doing so for years, claiming that there are terrorists, that they threaten national security, and that we must go after them. At the same time, an inflated sense of patriotism is encouraged in American citizens, so they believe their soldiers are fighting for freedom, despite doing the precise opposite. 
A great quote by Edward Bernays, who was known as the father of public relations, comes to mind here: 
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. ( source ) 
A number of politicians and academics from around the world have been trying to create awareness on this issue for decades, and although we’ve come a long way, our relatively slow progress demonstrates the stranglehold mainstream media has on the minds of the masses. 
“The statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.” 
– Mark Twain ( source ) 
Below, you’ll find 15 quotes on false flag terrorism and the secret government. False flag terrorism refers to the idea that terrorist attacks are created, perpetuated, and/or funded by Western governments and their allies in order to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Quotes on False Flag Terrorism and the Secret Government 
1. The Dalia Lama 
“Of course, war and the large military establishments are the greatest sources of violence in the world. Whether their purpose is defensive or offensive, these vast powerful organizations exist solely to kill human beings. We should think carefully about the reality of war. Most of us have been conditioned to regard military combat as exciting and glamorous – an opportunity for men to prove their competence and courage. Since armies are legal, we feel that war is acceptable; in general, nobody feels that war is criminal or that accepting it is criminal attitude. In fact, we have been brainwashed. War is neither glamorous nor attractive. It is monstrous. Its very nature is one of tragedy and suffering.” 
“Modern warfare waged primarily with different forms of fire, but we are so conditioned to see it as thrilling that we talk about this or that marvelous weapon as a remarkable piece of technology without remembering that, if it is actually used, it will burn living people. War also strongly resembles a fire in the way it spreads. If one area gets weak, the commanding officer sends in reinforcements. This is throwing live people onto a fire. But because we have been brainwashed to think this way, we do not consider the suffering of individual soldiers. No soldiers want to be wounded or die. None of his loved ones wants any harm to come to him. If one soldier is killed, or maimed for life, at least another five or ten people – his relatives and friends – suffer as well. We should all be horrified by the extent of this tragedy, but we are too confused.” 
“But no matter how malevolent or evil are the many murderous dictators who can currently oppress their nations and cause international problems, it is obvious that they cannot harm others or destroy countless human lives if they don’t have a military organisation accepted and condoned by society.” ( source ) 
2. Dr. Michel Chossudovsky, Canadian economist, the University of Ottawa’s Emeritus Professor of Economics 
“We are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level . . . and there is an ongoing war, it is led by the United States, it may be carried out by a number of proxy countries, which are obeying orders from Washington . . . The global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, it’s based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance and America’s allies in the Persian Gulf. . . . They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America. They’re not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor. . . . The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity.” 
“Al Qaeda and the Al Qaeda affiliated organizations, including the Islamic State, are not independent organizations, they are sponsored, and they are sponsored by the United States and its allies. It is documented that prior to 2011, there was a process of recruitment of mujahideen to fight in Syria, and this was coordinated by NATO and the Turkish high command. This report is confirmed by Israeli news sources and unequivocally, we are dealing with a state-sponsorship of terrorism, the recruitment of mercenaries, the training and the financing of terrorism.” ( source )( source ) 
3. Paul Hellyer 
“It is ironic that the U.S. would begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, when the most worrisome developments in this field are occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy, when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which both the Congress and the Commander in Chief have been kept deliberately in the dark.” ( source ) 
4. John C. Calhoun, The 7th Vice President of the United States 
“A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many, and various, and powerful interests, combined into one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.” ( source ) 
5. Robin Cook, Former British Foreign Secretary 
“The truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the ‘devil’ only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.” ( source ) 
6. John F. Hylan, Mayor of New York City from 1918-1925 
“The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation . . . The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties . . . [and] control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection.” ( source )( source ) 
7. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, highest ranking Asian-American politician in United States history 
“There exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.” ( source ) 
8. David Steele, the second-highest ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence and a former CIA clandestine services officer 
“Most terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We’ve become a lunatic asylum.” ( source ) 
9. Theodore Roosevelt. former President of the United States 
“Political parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people. 
From these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. 
To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.” ( source ) 
10. Benjamin Disraeli, First British MP 
“The world is governed by very different personages to what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.” ( Coningsby, Book 4, Chap. 15 , Page 131) 
11. Senator William Jenner 
“Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means … We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state … It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government … This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group … is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the courts. It is practically irremovable.” ( source ) 
12. Woodrow Wilson, former President of the United States 
“Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.” ( source ) 
13. Eric H. May, a former U.S. Army military intelligence and public affairs officer 
“The easiest way to carry out a false flag attack is by setting up a military exercise that simulates the very attack you want to carry out. As I’ll detail below, this is exactly how government perpetrators in the US and UK handled the 9/11 and 7/7 “terror” attacks, which were in reality government attacks blamed on ‘terrorists.’ ” ( source ) 
14. Professor Lance deHaven-Smith, Professor Emeritus of Public Administration and Policy, Florida State University 
“SCADs [which refers to State Crimes Against Democracy] involve high-level government officials, often in combination with private interests, that engage in covert activities for political advantages and power.” ( source )( source ) 
15. President John F. Kennedy 
“The very word ‘secrecy’ is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. . . . 
For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. 
Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.” ( source ) Share:",FAKE,arjun walia october   tensions between the united states their allies and russia continue to rise it

51.0,"Bernie Sanders’s vast universe of donors, mapped","Something interesting happened for Hillary Clinton in the third quarter of fundraising: Her fundraising centers softened.

During the second quarter, Clinton outraised Bernie Sanders handily, thanks to a lot of big-dollar donors. In the third quarter, the two were about tied. But look at how Clinton's donors were arrayed during the third quarter versus the second.

In the second quarter, Clinton received donations from about 5,300 ZIP codes. In the third quarter, that increased to 6,300.

That second quarter, when Clinton wrung a lot of money out of a lot of people, she pulled in a lot of money from Manhattan's wealthiest ZIP codes. In those ZIPs, roughly 10021 through 10028, Clinton raised $2 million from individuals in the second quarter. In the third quarter, she raised $725,000 -- a $1.3 million drop. (The densest area of circles below is Manhattan; you can also see the outline of Long Island to New York City's east.)

Notice how centralized her donations were in the second quarter compared to Sanders's. He got a lot more contributions from outlying ZIP codes.

This is what you'd expect to see from a candidate who got a lot of donors to max out early. Those areas subsequently have fewer donors to hit up.

But you might also have noticed how much better Sanders is doing in the lucrative New York market. Across the country, Sanders dramatically expanded the number of places from which he generated contributions, more than doubling the number of ZIP codes from which he got money from 3,400 to 8,400.

Sanders also saw an increase in how much he raised, versus the decrease Clinton experienced. We return to this chart that we published earlier this month.

Sanders has a lot more people now to whom he can go back for more money.",REAL,something interesting happened for hillary clinton in the third quarter of fundraising her fundraising centers softened during the second quarter clinton outraised bernie sanders handily thanks to a lot of bigdollar donors in the third quarter the two were about tied but look at how clintons donors were arrayed during the third quarter versus the second in the second quarter clinton received donations from about  zip codes in the third quarter that increased to  that second quarter when clinton wrung a lot of money out of a lot of people she pulled in a lot of money from manhattans wealthiest zip codes in those zips roughly  through  clinton raised  million from individuals in the second quarter in the third quarter she raised   a  million drop the densest area of circles below is manhattan you can also see the outline of long island to new york citys east notice how centralized her donations were in the second quarter compared to sanderss he got a lot more contributions from outlying zip codes this is what youd expect to see from a candidate who got a lot of donors to max out early those areas subsequently have fewer donors to hit up but you might also have noticed how much better sanders is doing in the lucrative new york market across the country sanders dramatically expanded the number of places from which he generated contributions more than doubling the number of zip codes from which he got money from  to  sanders also saw an increase in how much he raised versus the decrease clinton experienced we return to this chart that we published earlier this month sanders has a lot more people now to whom he can go back for more money,"['something', 'interesting', 'happened', 'hillary', 'clinton', 'third', 'quarter', 'fundraising', 'fundraising', 'centers', 'softened', 'second', 'quarter', 'clinton', 'outraised', 'bernie', 'sanders', 'handily', 'thanks', 'lot', 'bigdollar', 'donors', 'third', 'quarter', 'two', 'tied', 'look', 'clintons', 'donors', 'arrayed', 'third', 'quarter', 'versus', 'second', 'second', 'quarter', 'clinton', 'received', 'donations', 'zip', 'codes', 'third', 'quarter', 'increased', 'second', 'quarter', 'clinton', 'wrung', 'lot', 'money', 'lot', 'people', 'pulled', 'lot', 'money', 'manhattans', 'wealthiest', 'zip', 'codes', 'zips', 'roughly', 'clinton', 'raised', 'million', 'individuals', 'second', 'quarter', 'third', 'quarter', 'raised', 'million', 'drop', 'densest', 'area', 'circles', 'manhattan', 'also', 'see', 'outline', 'long', 'island', 'new', 'york', 'citys', 'east', 'notice', 'centralized', 'donations', 'second', 'quarter', 'compared', 'sanderss', 'got', 'lot', 'contributions', 'outlying', 'zip', 'codes', 'youd', 'expect', 'see', 'candidate', 'got', 'lot', 'donors', 'max', 'early', 'areas', 'subsequently', 'fewer', 'donors', 'hit', 'might', 'also', 'noticed', 'much', 'better', 'sanders', 'lucrative', 'new', 'york', 'market', 'across', 'country', 'sanders', 'dramatically', 'expanded', 'number', 'places', 'generated', 'contributions', 'doubling', 'number', 'zip', 'codes', 'got', 'money', 'sanders', 'also', 'saw', 'increase', 'much', 'raised', 'versus', 'decrease', 'clinton', 'experienced', 'return', 'chart', 'published', 'earlier', 'month', 'sanders', 'lot', 'people', 'go', 'back', 'money']","['PERSON', 'DATE', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'ORDINAL', 'DATE', 'PERSON', 'DATE', 'ORDINAL', 'PERSON', 'NORP', 'PERSON', 'CARDINAL', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'GPE', 'DATE', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'GPE', 'PERSON', 'DATE']","{'DATE': 9, 'PERSON': 8, 'GPE': 4, 'CARDINAL': 2, 'ORDINAL': 2, 'NORP': 1}",0,8,4,289,0.15795454545454546,11
7711.0,"Former Ambassador Andrew Young calls for end to water fluoridation, “Civil Rights Issue”","VIDEOS Former Ambassador Andrew Young calls for end to water fluoridation, “Civil Rights Issue” A letter has been sent demanding hearings to investigate why water fluoridation is being continued in the state despite all the reasons to end it By Brandon Turbeville - October 31, 2016 
Anti-fluoridation activists in Georgia received a major boost of support when former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Jimmy Carter, Andrew Young, sent a letter to Georgia Governor Nathan Deal and House Speaker David Ralston demanding hearings to investigate why water fluoridation is being continued in the state despite all the reasons to end it. 
Ambassador Young is asking for a written response. His letter was also sent to the CEO of the American Water Works Association, David LaFrance. 
“What’s clear to me is that we need a repeal of Georgia’s water fluoridation law, and hearings to look into how fluoridation has continued all these years, long after there were plenty of reasons to end it,” Ambassador Young wrote. 
“This is a civil rights issue, and the people have the right to have the full story given to them, rather than highly edited, misleading talking points.” 
Young also addressed the sketchy nature of the pro-fluoridation argument when he wrote, When someone’s story keeps changing, there are quite often motivations behind their changed stance that may not be aligned with the best interests of the public. The story offered by water fluoridation promoters keeps changing…and changing…and changing. There are key groups such as seniors, kidney patients, diabetics, communities of color, thyroid patients and people who drink a lot of water due to their occupation that are especially effected by Fluoridegate. 
“I am calling for Fluoridegate hearings, here, in Georgia and I am calling for a repeal of Georgia’s fluoridation law, immediately,” Young added.

Meanwhile, the Obama budget is out, and from the looks of it, it seems the president wants to swing for the fences on infrastructure, early childhood care and increased federal spending. But did he notice that Congress is controlled by the GOP? We'll discuss what compromises are possible.

""It's as though Democrats control both chambers of Congress. There is not an effort which he's made in previous budgets to meet them halfway, or more than halfway."" -- Sabrina Siddiqui

Finally, this was a big week for Downton Abbey-inspired congressional interior decoration scandals. We'll explain how it came to pass that we could put all those words in that previous sentence.

7661.0,"Syrian War Report – November 2, 2016: ISIS and Al-Nusra Attempt to Cut Off Govt Supply Line to Aleppo","Trump Whistles His Dogs ‹ › South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report – November 2, 2016: ISIS and Al-Nusra Attempt to Cut Off Govt Supply Line to Aleppo By South Front on November 2, 2016 …from SouthFront 
The Syrian Air Force has delivered a high number of air strikes in western Aleppo, targeting militants in in Al-Assad, Rashidin 4, Rashidin 5, the 1070 Apartment Project (1070 AP), Southern Sawmills and along the road to Khan Tuman. 
Since November 1, the fighting in the area has become stationary. The western part of the al-Assad Neighborhood is contested. The al-Nusra led coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, controls the southwestern part of the 1070 AP. The militants’ attacks on the 3000 Apartment Project have failed. 
In the 1070 AP, the government forces keep control of 3 groups of buildings. The supply line #1 has been cut off by Jaish al-Fatah. The supply line #2 is vulnerable to fire by militants. The government-controlled sector is separated from Jaish al-Fatah units by an open ground. This is why the militants are not able to take control of these building blocks. 
Clashes in this non-populated area allow the Syrian military to use its advantage in firepower to whittle the jihadist manpower and military equipment, repelling their frontal attacks. Jaish al-Fatah suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices remain the main threat to the army’s defenses. 
While Jaish al-Fatah cannot take control of the 1070 AP, the alliance’s attacks on the 3000 Apartment Project will hardly be able to lead to any success. 
Syrian troops have repelled an ISIS attack on the government only supply line to Aleppo in the sector between Ithriyah and al-Salamiyah. ISIS attacked the Syrian army in the Wadi al-Adhib region but was forced to retreat after a fierce battle. Last weekend, al-Nusra Front, the leading force of Jaish al-Fatah, attacked the supply line in the sector between Ithriyah and Aleppo, but also failed. 
This clearly shows that despite all controversies, ISIS and the so-called ‘moderate opposition’ are playing in the same game, attempting to prevent liberation of Aleppo by the government forces. 
Turkey’s engineer units are currently building a military base, with an airfield, in the area of Ziyar, south of the Syrian border town of al-Rai, the As Safir newspaper revealed. The newspaper believes that the Turkish regime is going implement the Iraq-like strategy in Syria and set a series of military installations in order to project the military power in the area. 
On November 1, Iraqi security forces (ISF) liberated the strategic Kurdish village of Gogjali in the eastern outskirts of Mosul and seized the nearby state-TV building. By doing this, the ISF has entered the ISIS-controlled city for the first time since it was occupied by ISIS in 2014.

7443.0,Should Christians Celebrate Halloween?,"Whether or not Christians should celebrate Halloween has been a controversial topic for decades. Some view dressing up, eating candy and enjoying the festivities harmless and innocent, while others view it as an offense to their faith. Americans spend nearly $6.9 billion yearly making it the second largest commercial holiday in the country. As commercialized as the celebration has become, many of its roots are completely paganist. Is this a cause for Christians to avoid the entire celebration?
This is a time of year filled with debate, but not necessarily politics. Many Christians are convinced that Halloween is a satanic holiday while the rest of the world has found their sweet spot complete with costumes and candy. Children and adults have the opportunity to dress in accordance with their imagination, confirming from its haunted history to modern festivities, this holiday is a big deal. With decorations, candy, parties, and costumes, the average American spends up to $75 in the spirit of celebration.
Halloween is the holiday that links the seasons of fall and winter. Reportedly, it originated with one of the ancient Celtic festivals; an event where people would wear various costumes and light bonfires in hopes of warding off roaming ghosts. However, by the late 1800s, Americans shifted the theory of Halloween into a holiday centered on community and fun events. The focus, for many, has transitioned from witchcraft and ghosts to neighborhood celebratory events. With the evolving of the focal point, should Christians change their stance to celebrate the holiday?
Despite having at least partial roots from a Christian tradition, the relationship between Halloween and Christians has long been complicated. On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther essentially started the Protestant Reformation in Wittenberg, Germany, when he nailed his 95 Theses to a door. Many of the early Christian groups that came to America rejected this holiday as pagan. The Protestant Reformation heavily influenced the Pilgrims, Puritans, Quakers, and Baptists causing the great majority to frown upon it. However, that did not prevent Halloween from finding its way to American shores.
In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III dedicated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs. The holiday became widely recognized as All Saints’ Day. The evening before was known as All Hallows’ Eve, which later became Halloween. The word “hallow” originated from the Old English word for “holy” and “e’en” is an abbreviation of “evening.” As such, Halloween represented the night before All Saints Day.
Over time, Halloween advanced into a secular, community-based holiday branded by child-friendly activities that include costumes, neighborhood trick-or-treating, and more recently, trunk-or-treating. Along with a variety of pumpkin-flavored foods, Parties for both children and adults have become a very common way to celebrate the holiday. Some Christians still choose to lock themselves indoors with the lights off, but others have found freedom in their faith and are at liberty to decide when and how to participate.
In multiple countries around the world, as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder, people continue to escort the winter season in with candy-coated gatherings and a wide range of costumes. Halloween is a celebration that allows people of all ages to participate. Nonetheless, the question remains, “Should Christians celebrate?”
Due to the efforts of community leaders and parents, Halloween has lost most of its illogical and religious undertones and is now more about imagination than spooky interpretation. There is nothing sinful about a Christian dressing up and participating in fun, non-threatening, celebrations. As a result, many Christians find no harm in dressing in costumes, attending parties and festivals as well as allowing their children to participate in school and local activities.

3700.0,Sunday in Charleston: Worship at Emanuel AME,"(CNN) The site of a horrific mass killing will become a house of worship again.

Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, will hold a service at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, according to CNN affiliate WCSC.

Nine people were shot to death Wednesday night at the church.

Authorities said Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina, admits he shot and killed the people he'd sat with for Bible study at the historicall y black church, two law enforcement officials said.

Roof is white and all the victims are black. He told investigators he did it to start a race war, according to one of the officials.

The church premises remained a crime scene, and thus off-limits to church members, until Charleston police released it Saturday.

One of the victims was the church's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. The Rev. Norvel Goff, presiding elder of Emanuel AME, told CNN he will give the sermon at the service.

Charleston, nicknamed the Holy City because it has so many churches, will remember the shooting victims in other ways.

On Sunday night, a unity chain will be held on the 13,200-foot-long Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Organizers hope to attract enough people to hold hands and stretch from Charleston to the town of Mount Pleasant on the other side of the Cooper River.

That message was echoed by Arthur Hurd, the husband of victim Cynthia Hurd. He's in the Merchant Marines and arrived in Charleston on Saturday.

'Hate's not in me'

""This is all surreal but what I can say to that young man is that in time I will forgive you,"" Hurd told CNN affiliate WCIV. ""I won't move past this but I will forgive you. But I hope for the rest of your life, however long or short that may be, you stop and play that tape over and over and over again in your head and see the sheer terror and pain you put purely innocent people through. ...""

""I would love to hate you but hate's not in me. If I hate you I'm no better than you.""

People angry about the killings took to the streets Saturday.

In Charleston, hundreds joined the March for Black Lives.

The group began the march in total silence as they walked to Emanuel AME Church from a nearby park, stopping outside the church to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial.

Once they passed the church, the group filled Charleston's iconic King Street, usually packed with tourists this time of year. Many carried signs of support for the victims of the Charleston shooting and the black community: ""STILL WE RISE,"" ""Hand in Hand,"" ""Do the right thing,"" ""Black Lives Matter,"" signs read.

The march ended with a rally outside the historic Daughters of the Confederacy building.

'Take it down'

""That terrorist did not win. He wanted to invoke terror and fear in our community, but we are not for that,"" an organizer said to the crowd. ""We are standing up together, arm in arm... We will not bow down, but we will stand up.""

Despite the sweltering heat, a large crowd filled the front grounds of the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia calling for the Confederate flag to be removed.

""Take it down, take it down,"" chanted the crowd filled with people of all races and ages holding signs.

One woman's sign said, ""Love breeds love, hate breeds hate"" and another man's sign says, ""Remove my ancestors sign.""

Organizers of the event, the South Carolina Progressive Network, estimates between 1,500 and 1,700 people attended.

The 2,000-word text explains the writer's philosophy of white superiority, saying the Trayvon Martin case ""truly awakened me"" and that ""I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.""

Motive has become the biggest question as state and federal investigators work on the case -- and statements and photos on the website match what investigators have determined so far.

For instance, CNN Charlotte affiliate WBTV, citing a source, says Roof told investigators in Shelby, North Carolina, where he was arrested, that he researched the church and targeted it because it turned out to be a ""historic African-American church.""

Three photos show Roof posing with a pistol. One closeup shows a gun that can be identified as a.45-caliber Glock -- the model of gun investigators say was used in the church shooting. Those photos were taken in April, after his 21st birthday, when his family said he purchased a .45-caliber gun.

The website, called the Last Rhodesian, is bare bones. Roof's name doesn't appear anywhere on the site but he is shown in many of the photos. An Internet ownership search shows the website was registered to Roof and listed as the administrator.

While the nation rallies behind Charleston, an insight into Roof's state of mind came from Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Watson.

Roof, he said, ""is in protective custody. He is currently sitting on his bed being monitored by two detention officers. He is on suicide watch.""

Roof may be prosecuted by federal authorities if it's determined he committed a hate crime. The Justice Department said ""it is looking at this crime from all angles, including as a hate crime and as an act of domestic terrorism.""

Funeral plans for Pinckney, who was a state senator, were announced Saturday.

Pinckney's casket will be at the State House rotunda lobby from 1-5 p.m. Wednesday. Public viewings will also be held Thursday at St. John AMC Church in Ridgeland and Emanuel AME Church.

The funeral will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at TD Arena on the College of Charleston campus.

8210.0,Only Making Matters Worse in Syria,"Only Making Matters Worse in Syria October 28, 2016 
Exclusive: Washington’s foreign policy establishment is determined to escalate U.S. military attacks in Syria even though that won’t resolve the conflict and will only get more people killed, a dilemma addressed by Daniel Lazare. 
By Daniel Lazare 
Middle East policy has reached an inflexion point, a moment when Official Washington seems to be caught in the middle between escalation and retreat. 
On one hand, the rhetoric has not been more militant since Hillary Clinton’s famous “we came, we saw, he died” moment in October 2011. With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington’s laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016. Power has been an advocate for escalating U.S. military involvement in Syria. (UN Photo) 
Thus, The New York Times assures us that that the Middle East is “desperate for American leadership” while the Washington Post reports that “the Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive American foreign policy.” 
Leading think tanks are publishing “a flurry of reports” urging stepped-up intervention, including U.S.-backed “safe zones to protect moderate rebels from Syrian and Russian forces” and even “limited” cruise-missile strikes. But while differing on the details, all agree something must be done. The time to act is now. 
As Vox puts it: “The hot new policy idea in Washington is the hottest old idea: direct US military intervention in Syria’s civil war.” 
But reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical “middle ground” in between him and Obama. 
While reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington’s vast foreign-policy establishment – sometimes known as “ the blob ” – the Washington Post notes that “even pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces” and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. 
“My concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,” it quotes one expert as saying, “but that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now.” 
Official Washington in a Bubble 
Thus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can’t have it. So what will it do? A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military. 
Then there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, “ The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes .” 
As Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a “story of flip-flops,” with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. 
But the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. 
“A siege,” Beauchamp then explains, “involves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad’s strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they’re likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.” 
The upshot, he says, is “a humanitarian crisis … roughly 250,000 people trapped in the city … running dangerously low on supplies, access to clean water and medicine.” So what should the U.S. do in response? The video’s tone at this point turns pessimistic and then pitch black: 
“The United States has the military power to break the siege of Aleppo,” Beauchamp says, “but doing so would be extremely dangerous. For one thing, it would need to coordinate with rebels on the ground, some of whom are extremists. For another, it means that the US would be operating in hostile air space with Russian planes.If the US were to engage with Russian planes, that could theoretically mean direct fire between two nuclear-armed superpowers, a risk that very few people in the United States are willing to take. And three, even if the US did temporarily break the siege, it would have to maintain a commitment to insure that things didn’t get worse. That could mean an open-ended war. And there’s no guarantee that this would make anything better, but, rather, it might just get more people killed over the long run.” 
So U.S. options are zero: “Every diplomatic solution tried so far has failed, and failed miserably, and there’s simply no economic tool that can be used to end the fighting or ease the suffering of the people inside besieged territories. There’s no good answer. There’s nothing that anyone has that could simply solve the crisis. It’s a disaster and a disaster without any end in sight.” 
Falsehoods and Obfuscations 
Beauchamp’s explanation – which is really not an explanation at all, merely an assertion – is studded with falsehoods and obfuscations. By describing Assad’s strategy as uniquely “vicious,” he ignores obvious parallels between the Russian air campaign in Aleppo and U.S. air assaults on Fallujah , Tikrit , and Ramadi , all in central Iraq and all largely destroyed in the course of “liberating” them from ISIS. U.S.-backed Syrian “moderate” rebels smile as they prepare to behead a 12-year-old boy (left), whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video. [Screenshot from the YouTube video] By referring to the events in Syria as a civil war, he fails to acknowledge the degree to which it is actually a foreign invasion by the U.S., Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf states. By repeatedly referring to the Salafists as “rebels” – which suggests that they are Syrians rising up from within – he ignores the fact that large numbers – 36,500, according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper – are foreign-born.
While asserting that 250,000 people are trapped inside east Aleppo, he ignores reports that the real figure is far lower. The Guardian ’s Martin Chulov, for example, estimated in March 2015 that only 40,000 people remained in rebel-held areas while Vice News reported last July that “most of Aleppo’s residents have fled the city. There are just a handful of civilians and rebel fighters holding on in the shattered ruins.” 
Beauchamp also implies that it is the government that has “trapped” people in east Aleppo when reports in the London Independent and elsewhere indicate that Salafists are firing on anyone trying to take the government up on its offer of safe passage. While acknowledging that “some” fighters are “extremists,” he ignores the fact that the U.S. military has admitted that Al Nusra, the local branch of Al Qaeda, is firmly in charge. 
When Salafists launched a short-lived offensive in east Aleppo last summer, for instance, The New York Times reported that they named it in honor of Ibrahim al-Yousef, a Muslim Brotherhood member who led a horrendous massacre of Alawite military cadets in 1979. It was indicative of how anti-Alawite sectarianism of the most bloodthirsty sort is the common denominator underlying all anti-government factions. 
One could go on, but the point is clear. The foreign-policy establishment has not only cut itself off from the public but, with the help of sympathetic media outlets like Vox, has cut itself off from its own intellectual history. Incapable of examining the U.S. role in the Syrian debacle in an honest and straightforward way, it can only blunder about in the dark, staggering backward or forward as circumstances dictate. Now seems to be the moment when it is poised between the two. 
So how will the United States respond now that Washington is preparing for a transition between Obama-style abstention and Hillary-style neo-conservatism? Here’s is one reporter’s modest attempt at reading the tea leaves: 
Washington will continue to fume as the catastrophe deepens in both Syria and Iraq. As the drive to push ISIS (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, and Daesh) out of Mosul in northern Iraq degenerates into ethno-sectarian warfare among Turks, Sunni Arabs, Shi‘ites, and Kurds, the drive to take back Raqqa, ISIS’s capital in north-central Syria will similarly falter as fighting breaks out between pro-Turkish forces and Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG. 
The fall of east Aleppo, which now seems to be a foregone conclusion, will drive the foreign-policy establishment to a fury. Obama may be able to hold the hawks off. But by the time he leaves office, “the blob” will be in an uproar and demanding that something be done. Map of Syria. 
With that, Zack Beauchamp will star in another Vox video entitled, “U.S. military intervention in Syria, explained in 4 minutes.” In it, he’ll tell how Russian atrocities in Aleppo, plus backhanded Syrian government support for ISIS, leave the U.S. no choice but to launch a swarm of cruise missiles at Syrian military facilities. 
When Russian soldiers are killed, he’ll try to shift blame to Vladimir Putin for stirring up trouble in the eastern Ukraine or the Baltics. He’ll note that dissent is limited to a few cranky websites and far-left groups, all of which can be safely ignored since they’re not part of the mainstream. Russia will then counter-attack, leading to … no one knows. 
While anything can go wrong with this scenario, one thing is clear. The mood in Official Washington is the opposite of 2003 when all the “experts” agreed that an invasion of Iraq would be a walk in the park. Now they’re filled with trepidation. But they’re still trying to talk themselves into an escalation and may succeed. If the election goes as expected, the Clinton II presidency will be an interesting one.

people are trapped inside east aleppo he ignores reports that the real figure is far lower the guardian s martin chulov for example estimated in march  that only  people remained in rebelheld areas while vice news reported last july that most of aleppos residents have fled the city there are just a handful of civilians and rebel fighters holding on in the shattered ruins beauchamp also implies that it is the government that has trapped people in east aleppo when reports in the london independent and elsewhere indicate that salafists are firing on anyone trying to take the government up on its offer of safe passage while acknowledging that some fighters are extremists he ignores the fact that the us military has admitted that al nusra the local branch of al qaeda is firmly in charge when salafists launched a shortlived offensive in east aleppo last summer for instance the new york times reported that they named it in honor of ibrahim alyousef a muslim brotherhood member who led a horrendous massacre of alawite military cadets in  it was indicative of how antialawite sectarianism of the most bloodthirsty sort is the common denominator underlying all antigovernment factions one could go on but the point is clear the foreignpolicy establishment has not only cut itself off from the public but with the help of sympathetic media outlets like vox has cut itself off from its own intellectual history incapable of examining the us role in the syrian debacle in an honest and straightforward way it can only blunder about in the dark staggering backward or forward as circumstances dictate now seems to be the moment when it is poised between the two so how will the united states respond now that washington is preparing for a transition between obamastyle abstention and hillarystyle neoconservatism heres is one reporters modest attempt at reading the tea leaves washington will continue to fume as the catastrophe deepens in both syria and iraq as the drive to push isis also known as isil islamic state and daesh out of mosul in northern iraq degenerates into ethnosectarian warfare among turks sunni arabs shiites and kurds the drive to take back raqqa isiss capital in northcentral syria will similarly falter as fighting breaks out between proturkish forces and kurdish peoples protection units or ypg the fall of east aleppo which now seems to be a foregone conclusion will drive the foreignpolicy establishment to a fury obama may be able to hold the hawks off but by the time he leaves office the blob will be in an uproar and demanding that something be done map of syria with that zack beauchamp will star in another vox video entitled us military intervention in syria explained in  minutes in it hell tell how russian atrocities in aleppo plus backhanded syrian government support for isis leave the us no choice but to launch a swarm of cruise missiles at syrian military facilities when russian soldiers are killed hell try to shift blame to vladimir putin for stirring up trouble in the eastern ukraine or the baltics hell note that dissent is limited to a few cranky websites and farleft groups all of which can be safely ignored since theyre not part of the mainstream russia will then counterattack leading to  no one knows while anything can go wrong with this scenario one thing is clear the mood in official washington is the opposite of  when all the experts agreed that an invasion of iraq would be a walk in the park now theyre filled with trepidation but theyre still trying to talk themselves into an escalation and may

5040.0,"FACT CHECK: Hillary Clinton's Speech To The Democratic Convention, Annotated","Editor's note: This has been updated at 1:25 p.m. ET Friday with additional fact-checking information.

Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic nomination for president Thursday night, delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs.

NPR's politics team annotated Clinton's speech below. Portions commented on are highlighted, followed by analysis, context and fact check in italics.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you all so so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all very, very much. Thank you for that amazing welcome. Thank you all for the great convention that we've had.

And Chelsea, thank you.

I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become.

Thank you for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.

And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago, it is still going strong.

You know, that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us.

And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.

On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my explainer-in-chief is still on the job.

I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime.

For all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight, and to those of you who joined this campaign this week. Thank you.

What a remarkable week it's been.

We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton.

And the man of Hope, Barack Obama.

America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship.

We heard from our terrific vice president, the one and only Joe Biden. He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do.

And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.

And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine — you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator.

And he will make the whole country proud as our vice president.

And ... I want to thank Bernie Sanders.

Bernie, Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.

You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.

And to all of your supporters here and around the country: I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.

Our country needs your ideas, energy and passion.

That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.

We wrote it together — now let's go out and make it happen together.

My friends, we've come to Philadelphia — the birthplace of our nation — because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.

We all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out — and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.

When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king. And some wanted to stick it to the king.

The revolution hung in the balance.

Then somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose.

And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.

That's what made it possible to stand up to a king.

That took courage. They had courage.

Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.

Now, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying.

And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together.

Our country's motto is ""e pluribus unum"": out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?

Well, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other.

He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way from ""Morning in America"" to ""Midnight in America."" He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.

Well, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.""

Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one.

And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!

We, we will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.

There's a lot of work to do.

Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash.

There's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad.

But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.

We should be so proud that those words are associated with us. I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America.

So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not.

Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do.

And most of all, don't believe anyone who says, ""I alone can fix it.""

Yes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.

Really? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting?

Troops on the front lines. Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.

He's forgetting every last one of us.

Americans don't say, ""I alone can fix it."" We say, ""We'll fix it together.""

And remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two-hundred-and-forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.

Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.

And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.

That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.

Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village. And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, ""What the heck do you mean by that?""

This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.

America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart.

That's why ""Stronger Together"" is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign.

It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.

A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in.

A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate.

That's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!

Now, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.

As you know, I'm not one of those people.

I've been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York.

Then I represented all of you as secretary of state.

But my job titles only tell you what I've done.

They don't tell you why.

The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ""service"" part has always come easier to me than the ""public"" part.

I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you.

The family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are.

They used whatever tools they had — whatever God gave them — and whatever life in America provided — and built better lives and better futures for their kids.

My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right.

My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.

When the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.

He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did.

My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She

ended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others.

Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.

And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: ""Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.""

So, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.

I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school — it just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.

It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.

So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.

It's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.

But how, how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door.

My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage — because we changed our law to make sure she got an education.

So it's true. I sweat the details of policy — whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich., the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.

Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid — if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.

After the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.

People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.

I first met Ryan as a 7-year-old. He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up.

Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.

Lauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.

I was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.

And in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.

And you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together.

Tonight, tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president.

Standing here, standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come.

I'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.

I'm happy for boys and men, too — because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.

So let's keep going, let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have.

But even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.

Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.

Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.

Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever.

Now that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.

We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.

I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them.

Some of you are frustrated — even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should.

Americans are willing to work — and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period.

Democrats, we are the party of working people. But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help.

So tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.

My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.

From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.

And here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.

That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.

And if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.

I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.

And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.

And I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.

I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.

Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together — and it's the right thing to do.

So, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.

If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.

If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us.

If you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us.

If you believe that we should say ""no"" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us.

If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us.

And yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us.

That's how we're going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.

Now, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes — and I do mean odd.

And he offered zero solutions.

But we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.

In my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.

If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.

And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.

Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!

We will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.

It's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can't refinance their debts.

And something we don't say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.

We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.

We will give small businesses like my dad's a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.

In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.

And we will help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ""woman card,"" then deal me in.

Now, here's the other thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them.

And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.

This is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is, and we are going to follow the money.

And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home!

Now, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?

Well, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as president.

But then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy.

Well, let's take a closer look.

In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.

Now, remember what the president said last night: ""Don't boo, vote."" People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it — not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them.

And you know that sales pitch he's making to be president? Put your faith in him — and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.

He also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of ""America First"" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.

Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again — well, he could start by actually making things in America again.

Now, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.

You know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.

From Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.

So, it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority.

I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot — now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security.

I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement — now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.

And I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.

I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.

We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.

It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake — we will prevail.

Now Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, ""I know more about ISIS than the generals do."" No, Donald, you don't.

He thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ""a disaster.""

Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.

We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death.

A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country — including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.

So just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief?

Donald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally.

Imagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.

I can't put it, I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men — the ones moved by fear and pride.

America's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.

And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.

I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.

We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.

You know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing?

You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage.

You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.

I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.

We have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more.

And that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.

So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.

Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.

We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.

And we will defend, we will defend all our rights — civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!

And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.

You know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments — excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.

They thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says — like when he called women ""pigs."" Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage.

Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain — a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.

Now, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom — that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.

But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it.

And in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great — because America is good.

So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change.

He's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country — to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.

The choice is clear, my friends.

Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger.

None of us ever have or can do it alone.

I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together.

But I'm here to tell you tonight — progress is possible.

I know, I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.

And I know it, I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.

Like so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. ""Go back out there,"" she said.

And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.

You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.

We lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.

That's what we need to do together as a nation.

Though ""we may not live to see the glory,"" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ""let us gladly join the fight.""

Let our legacy be about ""planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.""

That's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth.

The Founders showed us that. And so have many others since.

They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.

That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.

Yes, the world is watching what we do.

Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose.

So let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans.

Let's look to the future with courage and confidence.

Let's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.

And when we do, America will be greater than ever.

Thank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!",REAL,editors note this has been updated at  pm et friday with additional factchecking information hillary clinton accepted the

front and center where they belong and to all of your supporters here and around the country i want you to know ive heard you your cause is our cause our country needs your ideas energy and passion that is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for america we wrote it together  now lets go out and make it happen together my friends weve come to philadelphia  the birthplace of our nation  because what happened in this city  years ago still has something to teach us today we all know the story but we usually focus on how it turned out  and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all when representatives from  unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king the revolution hung in the balance then somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purpose and by the time they left philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nation thats what made it possible to stand up to a king that took courage they had courage our founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together now now america is once again at a moment of reckoning powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart bonds of trust and respect are fraying and just as with our founders there are no guarantees it truly is up to us we have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together our countrys motto is e pluribus unum out of many we are one will we stay true to that motto well we heard donald trumps answer last week at his convention he wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other hes betting that the perils of todays world will blind us to its unlimited promise hes taken the republican party a long way from morning in america to midnight in america he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well you know a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than  years ago during a much more perilous time the only thing we have to fear is fear itself now we are cleareyed about what our country is up against but we are not afraid we will rise to the challenge just as we always have we will not build a wall instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one and well build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy we we will not ban a religion we will work with all americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism theres a lot of work to do too many people havent had a pay raise since the crash theres too much inequality too little social mobility too much paralysis in washington too many threats at home and abroad but just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as americans to meet these challenges we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world we have the most tolerant and generous young people weve ever had we have the most powerful military the most innovative entrepreneurs the most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunity we should be so proud that those words are associated with us i have to tell you as your secretary of state i went to  countries when people hear those words they hear america so dont let anyone tell you that our country is weak were not dont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes we do and most of all dont believe anyone who says i alone can fix it yes those were actually donald trumps words in cleveland and they should set off alarm bells for all of us really i alone can fix it isnt he forgetting troops on the front lines police officers and firefighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe hes forgetting every last one of us americans dont say i alone can fix it we say well fix it together and remember remember our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so america would never be a nation where one person had all the power twohundredandforty years later we still put our faith in each other look at what happened in dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers police chief david brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them and you know how the community responded nearly  people applied in just  days thats how americans answer when the call for help goes out twenty years ago i wrote a book called it takes a village and a lot of people looked at the title and asked what the heck do you mean by that this is what i mean none of us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally alone america needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to making our nation better and stronger i believe that with all my heart thats why stronger together is not just a lesson from our history its not just a slogan for our campaign its a guiding principle for the country weve always been and the future were going to build a country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what zip code you live in a country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love trumps hate thats the country were fighting for thats the future were working toward and so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in americas promise that i accept your nomination for president of the united states now sometimes sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage as you know im not one of those people ive been your first lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of new york then i represented all of you as secretary of state but my job titles only tell you what ive done they dont tell you why the truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part i get it that some people just dont know what to make of me so let me tell you the family im from well no one had their name on big buildings my family were builders of a different kind builders in the way most american families are they used whatever tools they had  whatever god gave them  and whatever life in america provided  and built better lives and better futures for their kids my grandfather worked in the same scranton lace mill for  years because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did and he was right my dad hugh made it to college he played football at penn state and enlisted in the navy after pearl harbor when the war was over he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies i remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens he wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had and he did my mother dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl she ended up on her own at  working as a housemaid she was saved by the kindness of others her firstgrade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year the lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me no one gets through life alone we have to look out for each other and lift each other up and she made sure i learned the words from our methodist faith do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can so i went to work for the childrens defense fund going doortodoor in new bedford mass on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house she told me how badly she wanted to go to school  it just didnt seem possible in those days and i couldnt stop thinking of my mother and what shed gone through as a child it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws you need both understanding and action so we gathered facts we built a coalition and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities its a big idea isnt it every kid with a disability has the right to go to school but how how do you make an idea like that real you do it stepbystep yearbyyear sometimes even doorbydoor my heart just swelled when i saw anastasia somoza representing millions of young people on this stage  because we changed our law to make sure she got an education so its true i sweat the details of policy  whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in flint mich the number of mental health facilities in iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs because its not just a detail if its your kid  if its your family its a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president too after the four days of this convention youve seen some of the people whove inspired me people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine people like ryan moore and lauren manning they told their stories tuesday night i first met ryan as a yearold he was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed  pounds because i leaned over to lift him up children like ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the childrens health insurance program that covers  million kids in our country lauren manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on  it was the thought of her and debbie st john who you saw in the movie and john dolan and joe sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as i could in the senate on behalf of  families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero i was thinking of lauren debbie and all the others  years later in the white house situation room when president obama made the courageous decision that finally brought osama bin laden to justice and in this campaign ive met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change and with your help i will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the white house and you heard you heard from from republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign well i will be a president for democrats republicans and independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who dont for all americans together tonight tonight weve reached a milestone in our nations march toward a more perfect union the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president standing here standing here as my mothers daughter and my daughters mother im so happy this day has come im happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between im happy for boys and men too  because when any barrier falls in america it clears the way for everyone after all when there are no ceilings the skys the limit so lets keep going lets keep going until every one of the  million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves to have but even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead lets begin with what were going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead now i dont think president obama and vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes our economy is so much stronger than when they took office nearly  million new privatesector jobs twenty million more americans with health insurance and an auto industry that just had its best year ever now thats real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo not by a long shot were still facing deepseated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery ive gone around our country talking to working families and ive heard from many who feel like the economy sure isnt working for them some of you are frustrated  even furious and you know what youre right its not yet working the way it should americans are willing to work  and work hard but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them period democrats we are the party of working people but we havent done a good enough job showing we get what youre going through and were going to do something to help so tonight i want to tell you tonight how we will empower americans to live better lives my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states from my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from indian country to coal country from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures and heres what i believe i believe america thrives when the middle class thrives i believe that our economy isnt working the way it should because our democracy isnt working the way it should thats why we need to appoint supreme court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict them and if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united i believe american corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return many of them are but too many arent its wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other and i believe wall street can never ever be allowed to wreck main street again and i believe in science i believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of goodpaying clean energy jobs i believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy it would be selfdefeating and inhumane to try to kick them out comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together  and its the right thing to do so whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign if you believe that companies should share profits with their workers not pad executive bonuses join us if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care join us if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to china that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers then join us if you believe we should expand social security and protect a womans right to make her own health care decisions then join us and yes yes if you believe that your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay join us thats how were going to sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the top now you didnt hear any of this did you from donald trump at his convention he spoke for odd minutes  and i do mean odd and he offered zero solutions but we already know he doesnt believe these things no wonder he doesnt like talking about his plans you might have noticed i love talking about mine in my first hundred days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new goodpaying jobs since world war ii jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructure if we invest in infrastructure now well not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future and we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuitionfree for the middle class and debtfree for all we will also we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt its just not right that donald trump can ignore his debts and students and families cant refinance their debts and something we dont say often enough sure college is crucial but a fouryear degree should not be the only path to a good job we will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it we will give small businesses like my dads a boost make it easier to get credit way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and we will help you balance family and work and you know what if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me in now heres the other thing were not only going to make all these investments were going to pay for every single one of them and heres how wall street corporations and the superrich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes this is not because we resent success because when more than  percent of the gains have gone to the top  percent thats where the money is and we are going to follow the money and if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas well make them pay us back and well put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at home now now i imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking well that all sounds pretty good but how are you going to get it done how are you going to break through the gridlock in washington well look at my record ive worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people and if you give me the chance thats what ill do as president but then i also imagine people are thinking out there but trump hes a businessman he must know something about the economy well lets take a closer look in atlantic city  miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because donald trump refused to pay his bills now remember what the president said last night dont boo vote people who did the work and needed the money and didnt get it  not because he couldnt pay them but because he wouldnt pay them he just stiffed them and you know that sales pitch hes making to be president put your faith in him  and youll win big thats the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses then trump walked away and left working people holding the bag he also talks a big game about putting america first well please explain what part of america first leads him to make trump ties in china not colorado trump suits in mexico not michigan trump furniture in turkey not ohio trump picture frames in india not wisconsin donald trump says he wants to make america great again  well he could start by actually making things in america again now the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security you know anyone anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face from baghdad to kabul to nice and paris and brussels from san bernardino to orlando were dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated so its no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance looking for steady leadership wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority im proud that we put a lid on irans nuclear program without firing a single shot  now we have to enforce it and we must keep supporting israels security im proud that we shaped a global climate agreement  now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments including ourselves and im proud to stand by our allies in nato against any threat they face including from russia ive laid out my strategy for defeating isis we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground we will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country it wont be easy or quick but make no mistake  we will prevail now donald trump donald trump says and this is a quote i know more about isis than the generals do no donald you dont he thinks he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster well ive had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years including as a senator on the armed services committee and i know how wrong he is our military is a national treasure we entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces decisions about war and peace life and death a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country  including captain khan and the sons of tim kaine and mike pence both marines so just ask yourself do you really think donald trump has the temperament to be commander in chief donald trump cant even handle the roughandtumble of a presidential campaign he loses his cool at the slightest provocation when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter when hes challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons i cant put it i cant put it any better than jackie kennedy did after the cuban missile crisis she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with selfcontrol and restraint but by little men  the ones moved by fear and pride americas strength doesnt come from lashing out it relies on smarts judgment cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power and thats the kind of commander in chief i pledge to be and if were serious about keeping our country safe we also cant afford to have a president whos in the pocket of the gun lobby im not here to repeal the second amendment im not here to take away your guns i just dont want you to be shot by someone who shouldnt have a gun in the first place we will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass commonsense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals terrorists and all others who would do us harm you know for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch but i ask you how can we just stand by and do nothing you heard you saw family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage you heard you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals i refuse to believe we cant find common ground here we have to heal the divides in our country not just on guns but on race immigration and more and that starts with listening listening to each other trying as best we can to walk in each others shoes so lets put ourselves in the shoes of young black and latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable lets put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve and we will defend we will defend all our rights  civil rights human rights and voting rights womens rights and workers rights lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities and we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from you know for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off donald trumps comments  excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show they thought he couldnt possibly mean all the horrible things he says  like when he called women pigs or said that an american judge couldnt be fair because of his mexican heritage or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war like john mccain  a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect now at first at first i admit i couldnt believe he meant it either it was just too hard to fathom  that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things could be like that but heres the sad truth there is no other donald trump this is it and in the end it comes down to what donald trump doesnt get that america is great  because america is good so enough with the bigotry and bombast donald trumps not offering real change hes offering empty promises and what are we offering a bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country  to keep you safe to get you good jobs and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve the choice is clear my friends every generation of americans has come together to make our country freer fairer and stronger none of us ever have or can do it alone i know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart it can be hard to imagine how well ever pull together but im here to tell you tonight  progress is possible i know i know because ive seen it in the lives of people across america who get knocked down and get right back up and i know it i know it from my own life more than a few times ive had to pick myself up and get back in the game like so much else in my life i got this from my mother too she never let me back down from any challenge when i tried to hide from a neighborhood bully she literally blocked the door go back out there she said and she was right you have to stand up to bullies you have to keep working to make things better even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce we lost our mother a few years ago but i miss her every day and i still hear her voice urging me to keep working keep fighting for right no matter what thats what we need to do together as a nation though we may not live to see the glory as the song from the musical hamilton goes let us gladly join the fight let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see thats why were here  not just in this hall but on this earth the founders showed us that and so have many others since they were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow that is the story of america and we begin a new chapter tonight yes the world is watching what we do yes americas destiny is ours to choose so lets be stronger together my fellow americans lets look to the future with courage and confidence lets build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country and when we do america will be greater than ever thank you and may god bless you and the united states of america,"['editors', 'note',

9756.0,BUSTED: Clinton Foundation Directly Tied To Plot To Steal Election,"BUSTED: Clinton Foundation Directly Tied To Plot To Steal Election Posted on October 27, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This 
Ever since early voting began, numerous reports are claiming that the electronic voting machines are rigged, as votes for Donald Trump are automatically switched to Hillary Clinton. We’ve all begun to suspect that Hillary is behind the scam, and now, we have further proof that Democrats are the ones tampering with these machines as part of their intricate plan to steal the election. 
We recently reported how Hillary’s evil billionaire funder George Soros owns the voting machines in 16 key states, which immediately set off warning bells nationwide. Disturbingly, the massive fraud taking place is not just confined to those 16 areas, as another crooked player in Hillary’s election-stealing plot has just been revealed. 
In a bombshell just unearthed by independent researcher Micro Spooky Leaks , A Canadian company by the name of Dominion Voting provides the voting machines to 600 jurisdictions in 22 states and is directly linked to the Clinton Foundation as one of their massive donors. 
On their homepage, the company alludes to how they help rig elections, stating “ we strive to change elections for the better!” which is a chilling statement considering they supply 50% of the electronic voting machines on the U.S. voting market. 
Right after this startling information was revealed, however, it appears as though Democrats immediately began white-washing the information, as the link to the statement on the Wikipedia page that corroborated the bombshell information was mysteriously removed. 
Hillary has played dirty for years, and it appears as though her antics aren’t stopping now. After murdering many people close to exposing her scandals as a way to prevent them from ruining her presidential bid, the only thing left now is to steal the election through massive voter fraud. 
The picture at this point is becoming bleak. There’s no doubt that Donald Trump can defeat Hillary, as evidenced by his early lead in many historically blue states, and the recent bombshell that Hillary’s lead across many polls is completely fake. 
However, fighting back against electronic voting machines that have been calibrated by Hillary operatives to switch votes from Republican to Democrat will be extremely difficult. The only thing we can do at this point is demand a paper ballot when we vote. Dominion Voting machines that will be used in 22 states 
We are coming down to the wire here. Every day, more information surfaces on Hillary and the Democrats’ crooked scheme to steal the election. Continue to share stories like this and help fight back and spread the information.

2305.0,Connecticut Becomes First State To Boycott Indiana Over LGBT Discrimination Law,"WASHINGTON -- Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) will sign an executive order on Monday barring state-funded travel to Indiana because of the state's new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.

Malloy's move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Gov. Mike Pence (R) quietly signed into law last week. The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense. Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

Two cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed similar bans in response to the law. Businesses have also retaliated. Angie's List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis, and the CEO of Salesforce, a $4 billion software corporation, announced plans to ""dramatically reduce our investment"" in the state because of the law.

Twenty states have RFRA laws, but Indiana's law is substantially different. While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government, Indiana's law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens. That means, for example, a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under law.

The Indiana law could result in ""employers, landlords, small business owners, or corporations, taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so,"" reads their letter. ""Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employer's, their landlord's, their local shopkeeper's, or a police officer's private religious beliefs.""

That's in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut, which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions, not private establishments. And unlike some other states, Connecticut also doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institution.

Before signing the order, he called the Indiana law ""disturbing and outright discriminatory,"" and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state. Those games are set to begin later this week.

""I think that would be a wise choice for them to do if that's possible,"" said Malloy. ""I'll leave it up to them to make those decisions.""

The NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is ""surprised and disappointed"" by Indiana's law, and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law, or an outright repeal, before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the state.

Malloy said his executive order allows for any of the state's current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out, but said he doesn't plan to enter into any new ones.

""Somebody's got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and I'm prepared to do it,"" he said.",REAL,washington  connecticut gov dan malloy d will sign an executive order on monday barring statefunded

3008.0,Iran carries out new ballistic missile test,"Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of striking U.S. forces in the region as well as Israel, the third such test since the nuclear agreement with Western nations took effect in January, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News.

The rogue nation conducted the test in defiance of a United Nations resolution that calls on Iran to cease work on its ballistic missile program.

“Iran has to abide by U.N. resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles tests, and if they have violated or not been consistent with those resolutions, that clearly would be a concern for us,” Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said.

Any ballistic missile launch by Iran is tracked by U.S. military spy satellites which pick up the flash during launch. This case was no different, according to officials.

Gen. Ali Abdollahi, deputy chief of the armed forces' headquarters, said the latest missile tested is very accurate, within 8 meters. ""Eight meters means nothing, it means it's without any error,"" he said. He did not elaborate.

In March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles -- one emblazoned with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" in Hebrew -- that set off an international outcry.

Since December, Iran has shipped out its low-enriched uranium, disabled its heavy water reactor in Arak, and weeks ago sold more than $8 million worth of heavy water to the U.S. in compliance with the nuclear deal. However, Iran has ignored separate U.N. resolutions barring the Islamic republic from ballistic missile tests. Fox News was first to report a secret Iranian ballistic missile launch in November.

The test-firing was carried out two weeks ago, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Abdollahi as saying. Tasnim is close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program.

The agency said the missile has a range of 1,250 miles -- enough to reach much of the Middle East. Iranian military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting U.S. bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran.

Analysts say Iran is likely seeking to demonstrate it is making progress with its ballistic program, despite scaling back on the nuclear program following the deal that led to the lifting of international sanction on Tehran.

Last month, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, chief of the Guard's airspace division, said a new, upgraded version of the Sajjil -- a solid fuel high-speed missile with a range of 1,200 miles that was first tested in 2008 -- would soon be ready.

But it was not immediately clear if the missile Abdollahi referred to was the new Sajjil.

The landmark deal does not include provisions against missile launches and when it came into effect on Jan. 16, the Security Council lifted most U.N. sanctions against Tehran, including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

To deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the council adopted a resolution last July, which only ""calls on"" Iran not to carry out such tests.

6851.0,Assange: Donald Trump Won’t Be Allowed to Win – Clinton & ISIS Funded by Same Interests,"
In an excerpt of a John Pilger Special interview, Julian Assange says that emails released by Wikileaks show that Hillary Clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which US allies are supporting ISIS, and that Donald Trump will not be allowed into the oval office.
Assange explains that the same financial interests funding ISIS are funding Clinton. He references a 2014 email from John Podesta to Clinton, in which we find the following:
While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.

“I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,” said Assange. “All serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‘rogue’ princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.”
Pilger asked Assange about the possibility that Trump would steal the election with the help of Russia, as many in the Democratic party claim.
Assange thinks that this is highly unlikely, but not because he is unpopular. “My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them establishment,” he explained.
Assange says that Hillary is the establishment pick. “Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.” Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

3872.0,Why Joe Biden can't get no respect,"On Monday, I made the case that Al Gore should run for president. But there's another obvious contender out there, too: Joe Biden.

Over at Yahoo, Matt Bai makes the case for Biden. ""Biden,"" he writes, ""is a better candidate than most pundits have ever given him credit for. Yeah, he's sloppy and meandering and says some nutty stuff. But that's all part of being genuine and three-dimensional, which may be the most valuable trait in modern politics and not a bad contrast to Clinton's robotic discipline.""

And Biden's certainly got the resume. When President Barack Obama wanted to make sure stimulus money didn't disappear to fraud, he turned to Biden — ""nobody messes with Joe,"" he said — and Biden succeeded. When the White House wanted to avoid the fiscal cliff, it was Biden who closed the deal with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. When Obama flubbed the first debate against Mitt Romney, it was Biden who restored the ticket's mojo by bullying his way past Rep. Paul Ryan. When the Democrats held their 2012 convention, it was Biden's speech that pulled the highest ratings — beating both Bill Clinton and Obama.

Biden's most off-the-reservation moment, meanwhile, is the kind of thing that should help him in 2016. He pushed the Obama administration to embrace gay marriage before it was quite ready. At the time, it looked like a gaffe. Now it looks prescient.

And yet, according to a recent Marist poll, Biden is running 47 points behind Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 — and only one point ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A quick scan of RealClearPolitics' round-up of Democratic primary polls shows that's no outlier.

It's not like Biden has been out of the public eye for the last seven years. So why, if he's such a good politician, doesn't he command more support in the Democratic Party?

Here's my guess: there's a cultural gap between Biden and the party he seeks to represent. Biden is an old-school, white, male politician in a party that's increasingly young, multicultural, and female. Biden's gaffes matter because they tend to reinforce the perception among Democrats that he belongs to a different era.

When Biden calls shady lenders ""Shylocks,"" or says Obama is ""the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,"" he ends up coming off as, in New York Magazine words, ""your accidentally racist grandma."" That leaves Biden facing something more toxic than opposition: condescension.

What I wrote of Biden in January 2013 is still true today, I think. ""In the continuing drama that is the Obama presidency, Biden often appears as comic relief. He's the zany neighbor, the adorable uncle. As a result, his presidential ambitions, which burn brightly even today, have mostly been laughed off. Somehow, the sitting vice president of the United States, the former chairman of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, a man who's on a nickname basis with many of the world's most powerful leaders, is seen in many quarters as lacking the gravitas to be president.""

There is much that's weird about this. Hillary Clinton is a powerful candidate, but there's nothing about the last few months that makes her look invulnerable. She's shown real rust in interviews, pissed off liberals, and found herself in an email scandal.

But while Biden isn't much older than Clinton, she's somehow been more adept at signaling cultural affinity with young Democrats than he's been (though she's occasionally struggled too, most notably in her interview with Terry Gross on gay marriage). She also has a connection to female voters he can't touch. Even her memes are better.

I don't know exactly how Biden fixes this or even if he can. Clinton isn't inevitable, and Biden should, by all rights, pose a real threat to her. But, though Biden's always been known as a great speaker, he needs to learn to talk to a different party than the one he grew up in.",REAL,on monday i made the case that al gore should run for

What do you mean you’re not feverishly plotting a presidential bid three years before the next election? Is there something wrong with you?

I guess we don’t like to take no for an answer.

Take Paul Ryan. A natural leader of the conservative movement. The Republican VP nominee last year. A man who can translate Beltway jargon into Main Street concerns.

The Wisconsin congressman is in the spotlight because he just hammered out a budget agreement with Patty Murray that passed the Senate yesterday with 64 votes—three fewer than supported a cloture vote—after winning bipartisan approval in the House. The modest deal is noteworthy mainly because it temporarily ends the Washington gridlock and threats of shutdown and default. But it also brought sniping from more militant conservatives who see Ryan as selling out to the Democrats.

The dustup triggered a spate of Whither Paul Ryan pieces in the press.  Is he running? Is he not running? It’s 2013 already — we have to know!

“In interviews The Hill conducted with more than two dozen House Republicans from across the ideological spectrum over the last couple of weeks, many of Ryan’s colleagues said they are doubtful he will run for president in 2016. Most believe that concerns for his young family will lead him to lay claim to the job he’s always wanted: chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.”

Ryan wants to be a Hill poohbah and not move into the White House.

“Ryan on Tuesday told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to lead the Ways and Means Committee in the next Congress. Ryan and his wife Janna have three children, and his friends say that his concern about the hardship of an 18-month presidential campaign is a genuine factor in his consideration.”

This is the human factor that journalists rarely pause to consider. Running for president is a meat grinder that chews people up, and Ryan got a taste of that as Mitt Romney’s running mate.

I don’t know whether Ryan  is being coy, or whether, with the highest positive rating among Iowa Republicans, he’ll change his mind and jump into the race. But I do think the press ought to take him at his word until there’s evidence to the contrary.

I guess it wasn’t a big story when John Podesta compared the Republicans to a suicide cult.

But now that Podesta is joining President Obama’s inner circle, Politico is asking: “Can John Podesta Save Him?” (Boy, that’s a tall order.)

In its profile of Podesta, who is stepping down as head of the Center for American Progress, this incendiary quote was slipped into the narrative without comment.

White House officials, said Podesta, “need to focus on executive action given that they are facing a second term against a cult worthy of Jonestown in charge of one of the houses of Congress.”

Podesta was comparing John Boehner to Jim Jones, who led his followers to kill themselves? Didn’t that set off any alarm bells?

But the quote caused a stir now that the former Bill Clinton chief of staff is joining the White House, and he tweeted an apology: “In an old interview, my snark got in front of my judgment. I apologize to Speaker Boehner, whom I have always respected.”

4239.0,Why Bernie Sanders needs to start winning big states — big,"Six days ago, Bernie Sanders pulled off one of the great upsets in modern politics — surging from more than 20 points behind in the polls to edge out Hillary Clinton and win Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary.

It was remarkable! It was historic! And it netted him four more delegates than Clinton in the state. Meanwhile, in Mississippi, Clinton won with more than 80 percent of the vote — and gained 28 more delegates than Sanders.

On the best night of the Sanders campaign to date, he fell 24 more delegates behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination.

That increasingly challenging math is what Sanders must confront Tuesday as voters in several large states — including Florida, Illinois and Ohio — go to the polls.

[Clinton leads Sanders by more than 2 to 1 in Florida, Post-Univision poll finds]

As of today, Clinton has 1,231 delegates to Sanders’s 576 — a lead of 655. That means that Clinton has 51.7 percent of the 2,383 delegates she needs to become the Democratic Party’s nominee.

Subtract superdelegates — Clinton is dominating even among this group of elected officials and party luminaries — and she has 766 delegates to Sanders’s 551, a margin of 215. (Worth noting: That is a wider lead than the margin by which Clinton ever trailed then-Sen. Barack Obama in the long slog of the 2008 primary race.)

That lead may not seem momentous. After all, almost 3,000 delegates are yet to be allocated in the primaries and caucuses to come. The problem for Sanders is that Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally in every state — meaning that between now and when the process ends June 7, there is no state where Clinton will be shut out.

Winning, then, is not enough for Sanders. He has to win by a lot to make up any real ground.

Clinton has already done that. Take, for example, Alabama. She won there March 1 by 59 points and gained 38 more delegates than Sanders. Or Georgia on that same day, beating Sanders by 43 points and netting 55 delegates. Or the aforementioned Mississippi, where Clinton’s 66-point win translated to a net gain of 28 delegates.

[Southern states help Clinton extend her lead over Sanders]

Sanders’s one big win came in New Hampshire’s primary. But his 22-point margin translated to a net delegate gain of zero because six superdelegates pledged to Clinton, bringing her delegate gain up to match his. Similarly, in the Colorado caucuses, Sanders won by 19 points but the superdelegate math meant the candidates each took 38 delegates.

Look at the next set of big contests, to be held Tuesday. Four states have more than 100 delegates to give out: Florida (246), Illinois (182), Ohio (160) and North Carolina (121).

Polling released Sunday morning suggests that Sanders has a big hill to climb. Clinton leads the senator 61 percent to 34 percent in Florida and has an edge of 58 percent to 38 percent in Ohio, according to NBC- Marist surveys. The race in Illinois, according to NBC-Marist, is closer, with Clinton at 51 percent and Sanders at 45 percent.

But wait, you say. Polling in Michigan had Sanders down 20 points and he won there. So this polling could be wrong, too.

Sure. It could. The problem for Sanders is this: Let’s say each of the NBC-Marist surveys is off by 20 points in Clinton’s favor. (Note that this is a thought experiment. I very much doubt a credible pollster such as this one would be off by even close to that amount.) That would mean Sanders loses Florida by single digits, essentially ties Clinton in Ohio and wins Illinois by 15 points. The delegate allocation from that trio of results? It would almost certainly favor Clinton.

Sanders is in a position where winning states is not close to enough if he wants to be the party’s nominee. He needs to start winning big states by big margins. As in winning Illinois or Florida by 30 or 40 points.

That seems very unlikely either Tuesday or beyond. If past votes are any guide, it will be a tough road for Sanders. There have been seven election nights in the race so far; Clinton has netted delegates in six of them, while the two candidates fought to a draw in the seventh (New Hampshire).

None of this means that Sanders can’t — and won’t — keep running. Winning states matters in terms of perception and keeps the wolves from his door. But winning states and emboldening your supporters aren’t the same as taking concrete steps to reduce or eliminate Clinton’s delegate lead.

3282.0,Leaked: What’s in Obama’s trade deal,"A recent draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal would give U.S. pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs, possibly transcending the patent protections in U.S. law.

POLITICO has obtained a draft copy of TPP’s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11, at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam. While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document, they downplayed its importance, emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages. Those terms are still secret, but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval.

Still, the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP’s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients, businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim. The highly technical 90-page document, cluttered with objections from other TPP nations, shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and, at least until Guam, successfully on behalf of Big Pharma.

The draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brand-name pharmaceuticals abroad. Those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cutting-edge drugs known as “biologics” inside the U.S., restricting treatment for American patients while jacking up Medicare and Medicaid costs for American taxpayers.

“There’s very little distance between what Pharma wants and what the U.S. is demanding,” said Rohit Malpini, director of policy for Doctors Without Borders.

Throughout the TPP talks, the Obama administration has pledged to balance the goals of fostering innovation in the drug industry, which means allowing higher profits, and promoting wider access to valuable medicines, which means keeping prices down. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has pointed out that pharmaceutical companies often have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to get a new drug to market, which they would have little incentive to do without strong protections for the patented product. But Froman has also recognized the value of allowing much cheaper generic drugs to enter the market after those brand-name patents expire. In the U.S., generics now comprise more than five-sixths of all prescription drugs, but only about one-quarter of drug costs.

Advocates for the global poor, senior citizens, labor unions and consumers as well as the generics industry have accused the administration of abandoning that balance, pushing a pharmaceutical-company agenda at the expense of patients and taxpayers. One critic, hoping to illustrate the point and rally opposition to TPP in Congress, gave POLITICO the draft chapter, which was labeled “This Document Contains TPP CONFIDENTIAL Information” on every page.

U.S. officials said the key point to remember about trade deals is that no provision is ever final until the entire deal is final—and that major compromises tend to happen at the very end of the negotiations. They expect the real horse-trading to begin now that Obama has signed “fast-track” legislation requiring Congress to pass or reject TPP without amendments.

“The negotiations on intellectual property are complex and continually evolving,” said Trevor Kincaid, a spokesman for Froman. “On pharmaceutical products, we are working closely with stakeholders, Congress, and partner countries to develop an approach that aims to make affordable life-saving medicine more widely available while creating incentives for the development of new treatments and cures. Striking this important balance is at the heart of our work.”

The draft chapter covers software, music and other intellectual property issues as well, but its most controversial language involves the rights of drug companies. The text reveals disputes between the U.S. (often with support from Japan) and its TPP partners over a variety of issues—what patents can cover, when and how long they can be extended, how long pharmaceutical companies can keep their clinical data private, and much more. On every issue, the U.S. sided with drug companies in favor of stricter intellectual property protections.

Some of the most contentious provisions involve “patent linkage,” which would prevent regulators in TPP nations from approving generic drugs whenever there are any unresolved patent issues. The TPP draft would make this linkage mandatory, which could help drug companies fend off generics just by claiming an infringement. The Obama administration often describes TPP as the most progressive free-trade deal in history, citing its compliance with the tough labor and environment protections enshrined in the so-called “May 10 Agreement” of 2007, which set a framework for several trade deals at the time. But mandatory linkage seems to be a departure from the May 10 pharmaceutical provisions.

In an April 15 letter to Froman, Heather Bresch, the CEO of the generic drug company Mylan, warned that mandatory patent linkage would be “a recipe for indefinite evergreening of pharmaceutical monopolies,” leading to the automatic rejection of generic applications. The U.S. already has mandatory linkage, but most other TPP countries do not, and Bresch argued that U.S. law includes a number of safeguards and incentives for generic companies that have not made it into TPP.

“With all due respect, the USTR has…cherry-picked the single provision designed to block generic entry to the market,” Bresch wrote.

Generics are thriving in the U.S. despite linkage, saving Americans an estimated $239 billion on drugs in 2013. But the U.S. is the world’s largest market, and advocates fear that generic manufacturers may not take on the risk and expense of litigation in smaller markets if TPP tilts the playing field against them. One generics manufacturer, Hospira, reportedly testified at a TPP forum in Melbourne, Australia, that it would not launch generics outside the U.S. in markets with linkage.

The opponents are also worried about the treaty’s effect on the U.S. market, because its draft language would extend mandatory patent linkage to biologics, the next big thing in the pharmaceutical world. Biologics can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for patients with illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis B and cancer, and the first knockoffs have not yet reached pharmacies. The critics say that extending linkage to biologics—which can have hundreds of patents—would help insulate them from competition forever.

“It would be a dramatic departure from U.S. law, and it would put a real crimp in the ability of less expensive drugs to get to market,” said K.J. Hertz, a lobbyist for AARP. “People are going to look at this very closely in Congress.”

Drug companies are already pushing for TPP to guarantee them 12 years of exclusivity for their data regarding biologics, although the draft text suggests the other TPP nations have not agreed. Jay Taylor, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it’s crucial for TPP to protect the intellectual property that emerges from years of expensive research, so that drug companies can continue to develop new medicines for patients around the world.

“These innovations could be severely hindered if IP protections are scaled back,” Taylor said. “This is especially important in the area of biologic medicines, which could hold the key to unlocking treatments for diseases that have thwarted researchers for years.”

U.S. officials would not discuss the status of the TPP talks. But they suggested the May 10 Agreement did include a milder form of linkage, although it didn’t prevent regulators from approving generics mired in patent disputes.  They also believe a 2009 U.S. law included a form of linkage for biologics, although again, that law's dispute resolution process for patent issues was not as prescriptive as the TPP draft. And they cautioned that any pre-Guam draft would not reflect recent negotiations over “transition periods” that would delay the stricter patent standards in developing countries like Vietnam.

In any case, Kincaid said U.S. negotiators are determined to strike a balance between innovation and access in the final product.

“While this is our touchstone, the negotiations are still very much in process, and the details of a final outcome cannot yet be forecasted,” he said.

But Malpani of Doctors Without Borders said U.S. negotiators have basically functioned as drug lobbyists. The TPP countries have 40 percent of global economic output, and the deal is widely seen as establishing new benchmarks for some of the most complex areas of global business. Malpani fears it could set a precedent that crushes the generic drug industry under a mountain of regulation and litigation.

“We consider this the worst-ever agreement in terms of access to medicine,” he said. “It would create higher drug prices around the world—and in the U.S., too.

",REAL,a recent draft of the transpacific partnership freetrade deal would give us pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs possibly transcending the patent protections in us law politico has obtained a draft copy of tpps intellectual property chapter as it stood on may  at the start of the latest negotiating round in guam while us trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document they downplayed its importance emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages those terms are still secret but the public will get to see them once the twelve tpp nations reach a final agreement and president obama seeks congressional approval still the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that tpps protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients businesses and governments around the pacific rim the highly technical page document cluttered with objections from other tpp nations shows that us negotiators have fought aggressively and at least until guam successfully on behalf of big pharma the draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brandname pharmaceuticals abroad those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cuttingedge drugs known as biologics inside the us restricting treatment for american patients while jacking up medicare and medicaid costs for american taxpayers theres very little distance between what pharma wants and what the us is demanding said rohit malpini director of policy for doctors without borders throughout the tpp talks the obama administration has pledged to balance the goals of fostering innovation in the drug industry which means allowing higher profits and promoting wider access to valuable medicines which means keeping prices down us trade representative michael froman has pointed out that pharmaceutical companies often have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to get a new drug to market which they would have little incentive to do without strong protections for the patented product but froman has also recognized the value of allowing much cheaper generic drugs to enter the market after those brandname patents expire in the us generics now comprise more than fivesixths of all prescription drugs but only about onequarter of drug costs advocates for the global poor senior citizens labor unions and consumers as well as the generics industry have accused the administration of abandoning that balance pushing a pharmaceuticalcompany agenda at the expense of patients and taxpayers one critic hoping to illustrate the point and rally opposition to tpp in congress gave politico the draft chapter which was labeled this document contains tpp confidential information on every page us officials said the key point to remember about trade deals is that no provision is ever final until the entire deal is finaland that major compromises tend to happen at the very end of the negotiations they expect the real horsetrading to begin now that obama has signed fasttrack legislation requiring congress to pass or reject tpp without amendments the negotiations on intellectual property are complex and continually evolving said trevor kincaid a spokesman for froman on pharmaceutical products we are working closely with stakeholders congress and partner countries to develop an approach that aims to make affordable lifesaving medicine more widely available while creating incentives for the development of new treatments and cures striking this important balance is at the heart of our work the draft chapter covers software music and other intellectual property issues as well but its most controversial language involves the rights of drug companies the text reveals disputes between the us often with support from japan and its tpp partners over a variety of issueswhat patents can cover when and how long they can be extended how long pharmaceutical companies can keep their clinical data private and much more on every issue the us sided with drug companies in favor of stricter intellectual property protections some of the most contentious provisions involve patent linkage which would prevent regulators in tpp nations from approving generic drugs whenever there are any unresolved patent issues the tpp draft would make this linkage mandatory which could help drug companies fend off generics just by claiming an infringement the obama administration often describes tpp as the most progressive freetrade deal in history citing its compliance with the tough labor and environment protections enshrined in the socalled may  agreement of  which set a framework for several trade deals at the time but mandatory linkage seems to be a departure from the may  pharmaceutical provisions in an april  letter to froman heather bresch the ceo of the generic drug company mylan warned that mandatory patent linkage would be a recipe for indefinite evergreening of pharmaceutical monopolies leading to the automatic rejection of generic applications the us already has mandatory linkage but most other tpp countries do not and bresch argued that us law includes a number of safeguards and incentives for generic companies that have not made it into tpp with all due respect the ustr hascherrypicked the single provision designed to block generic entry to the market bresch wrote generics are thriving in the us despite linkage saving americans an estimated  billion on drugs in  but the us is the worlds largest market and advocates fear that generic

9239.0,"Michael Moore admits no women ever melted the ice caps, bombs American history","  Posted at 11:03   
Michael Moore was super excited to learn that Republicans were driving traffic to his film , “Trumpland,” by passing around on social media a four-minute clip, even though he claims it was doctored. That’s not cool — if anyone’s going to doctor the footage in a Michael Moore movie, its going to be Michael Moore. 
Obviously Moore’s not a Donald Trump fan, and like many other liberals this weekend, he’s not an Anthony Weiner fan. Setting aside Judicial Watch’s lawsuit against the State Department, Hillary Clinton almost looked to be in the clear a few months back, but now her email shenanigans have returned to the front pages, all because of Weiner’s compulsion to send vulgar selfies online. Unbelievable that once again Hillary has to suffer the abuse of men & their dickish behavior. Bubba, Weiner, Trump, Newt, Comey. Sick of it. 
— Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 29, 2016 
What did Bill Clinton do that was so wrong? Hillary long ago established that he was the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy. And Weiner? Sure, be angry at him for the way he’s treated his wife and the women he’s sexted, but there would be no sensitive emails on his laptop if Hillary and company had simply used the secure government email accounts provided to them. 
Moore was just getting started on his misandrist rant, and when he’s on a roll, it’s best to step away until he’s finished it. The day can't come soon enough when women will take charge. Public policy will not be decided by dick pix, Tic Tacs, grab-assers or the GOP.

4532.0,Someone Isn't Telling The Truth About Freddie Gray's Death,"By now, everybody knows the injuries that contributed to Freddie Gray's death. Baltimore authorities and representatives for Gray’s family agree that the 25-year-old sustained fatal trauma to his neck and spine at some point while in police custody following his arrest on April 12. Although a full autopsy hasn't yet been released, the family has said that Gray’s spine was nearly severed, and that his doctors had attempted to repair three fractured neck vertebrae and a crushed voice box. Last week, The Baltimore Sun spoke to medical experts who said that Gray's injuries were, in the paper's words, comparable to those seen in “victims of high-speed crashes.”

While this may end up being a significant detail of the investigation, much is still unclear about the circumstances of Gray's death, including how Gray's head might have hit the wall of the van hard enough to kill him. Over the past few weeks, Baltimore police have provided few answers about how Gray went from seemingly healthy enough to flee police on the morning of April 12 to dead on April 19 after a week in a coma. On Wednesday, April 29, hours after stating that they would not give the public their forthcoming internal report on Gray's death, police leaked a different document to The Washington Post. It was the first new piece of information from police in nearly a week. But instead of clarity, it offered more confusion.

In its reporting of the incident, The Baltimore Sun found witnesses who refuted Miller's account to the court. In an April 25 article, Sun reporter Kevin Rector wrote: “Kevin Moore, a 28-year-old friend of Gray's from Gilmor Homes, said he rushed outside when he heard Gray was being arrested and saw him ‘screaming for his life’ with his face planted on the ground. One officer had his knee on Gray's neck, Moore said, and another was bending his legs backward. ‘They had him folded up like he was a crab or a piece of origami,’ Moore said. ‘He was all bent up.’"" Others claimed to have seen officers beating Gray with batons.

At one point during the arrest, according to the police commissioner, an officer pulled out a stun gun. Moore claimed to have seen this as well. According to the Sun, police investigators failed to obtain footage from a convenience store surveillance camera that may have captured the incident more clearly. Instead, the officers found that the moment in question had been taped over by the time they got there. This was a common theme throughout the investigation, as officers reportedly failed to obtain footage from other cameras that may have recorded key moments in Gray's subsequent ride to the police station.

A third perspective on Gray's arrest was added to the mix on Wednesday, when CNN interviewed an anonymous relative of one of the arresting officers. The woman said the officer believes Gray ""was injured outside the paddy wagon,"" though she expressed personal concern that ""six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.""

This is the critical question, and there is still no clear answer. Witness video shows Gray screaming at the time he was loaded into the vehicle. According to the official police timeline, the van made its first stop four minutes later so that officers could shackle an ""irate"" Gray. He was removed from the van and was placed in leg irons.

Police and witnesses then agree that Gray was returned to the van in both hand and leg restraints. Officers have admitted they didn't buckle Gray's seat belt, a violation of police department policy that has led to suggestions that Gray may have been the victim of a ""rough ride"" -- an illegal but not uncommon technique in which officers drive vans in such a way as to cause injury to detained passengers.

At 8:59 a.m., about 15 minutes after Gray was first put in the van, the vehicle stopped for a third time after the driver asked an officer to perform a check on Gray. This had previously been explained as the second stop, and exactly what happened there was reportedly a key part of the investigation. Batts has said that responding officers had to ""pick [Gray] up off the floor and place him on the seat,"" and that Gray requested a medic at this time. He was ignored again.

The fourth and final stop was made minutes later to pick up another prisoner. At this point, it's unclear what state Gray was in. Davis has suggested that Gray was again found on the floor, but responsive enough to make another request for a medic. If this request was indeed made, it was evidently denied. Other reports suggest that Gray may have already lost consciousness when this second person was picked up.

Details of Allen's account conflict with earlier reports on Gray's time in the van, including reports from police officials themselves. According to the Post, Allen told investigators that Gray was “banging against the walls” and ""intentionally trying to injure himself.” But Allen later told WBAL: ""When I got in the van, I didn't hear nothing. It was a smooth ride. We went straight to the police station. All I heard was a little banging for about four seconds. I just heard little banging, just little banging.""",REAL,by now everybody knows the injuries that contributed to freddie grays death baltimore authorities and representatives for grays family agree

4130.0,Prison employee pleaded not guilty to aiding escape of two murderers,"The female prison employee at the center of an investigation into the escape of two killers pleaded not guilty Friday night to helping them flee the maximum security facility.

Prison tailor shop instructor Joyce Mitchell, 51, was arraigned on a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and misdemeanor count of criminal facilitation, authorities said.

Mitchell is accused of aiding in the escape of inmates David Sweat and Richard Matt from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York last week.

She entered the court room with her hands cuffed in front of her, clad jeans and a lime green top looking terrified. She did not speak. She was ordered held in jail on $100,000 cash bail or $200,000 bond on felony county and is due back in court Monday morning.

District Attorney Andrew Wylie said earlier Friday the contraband did not include the power tools used by the men as they cut holes in their cell walls and a steam pipe to escape through a manhole last weekend.

Wylie didn't elaborate on the charges Friday as more than 800 officers continued to search for the escapees, concentrating in a rural area around the prison in the Adirondacks near the Canadian border. Earlier residents reported seeing  tow men jumping a stone wall outside Dannemora.

Maj. Charles Guess of the New York State gave a stern warning to the convicts at an evening press conference,

""We're coming for you and will not stop until you are caught,"" he said.

He added that Mitchell's arrest represented ""one large piece of the puzzle in our quest"" to find the men.

Asked about any clues to the escapees' whereabouts, Guess said there was no ""conclusive evidence"" that either had left the area. None of the reports of possible sightings has been confirmed, he added.

""It's day six,"" he said, ""and if they have not escaped the area, you've got to assume they're cold, wet, tired and hungry.""

As to whether they split up, Guess said, ""there's no reason to believe they're not together but we're planning for both eventualities.""

Earlier, Wylie said Mitchell, a supervisor in the prison's tailoring shop, brought ""contraband"" into the prison but he declined to elaborate on what, specifically, she gave the men.

The Albany Times-Union reported late Thursday that Mitchell told New York State Police she gave Matt, 48, and Sweat, 34, access to a cell phone and smuggled tools into the prison.

A police source close to the investigation confirmed to Fox News Friday that Mitchell planned to provide a getaway car for the two convicted murderers but had a change of heart at the last minute. Mitchell instead checked herself into a hospital some 40 miles away from the prison, complaining of panic attacks, according to law enforcement.

Mitchell joined the prison staff in March of 2008 and earned $57,697 a year. She was suspended without pay, effective Friday.

Police, meanwhile, said Friday that two men believed to be the inmates were spotted jumping over a stone wall in the woods in Saranac, a few miles from the prison, the Buffalo News reported. According to the newspaper, a law enforcement officer said he believes he saw the two at 7:30 a.m. Friday and authorities converged on the area.

Colleen Cringle, who lives on Cringle road in Saranac, told the newspaper police were using her home as a staging area to search for the killers.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has vowed that state law would come down hard on any prison system employee who crosses the line with inmates.

""If you do it, you will be convicted, and then you'll be on the other side of the prison that you've been policing, and that is not a pleasant place to be,"" Cuomo said. The governor also said investigators are ""talking to several people who may have facilitated the escape.""

The Times-Union also reported that Mitchell had been investigated in recent months by the state corrections department's inspector general after a fellow prison worker complained that she had gotten too close to Sweat and Matt. That investigation did not result in any discipline.

Prison employees and correction officers are prohibited from having relationships with inmates or performing favors for them.

Matt was serving 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of Matt's 76-year-old former boss, whose body was found in pieces in a river.

Matt and an accomplice stuffed William Rickerson in a car trunk in his pajamas and drove around with him for 27 hours because he wouldn't tell them the location of large sums of money he was believed to have.

According to testimony, Matt bent back the elderly man's fingers until they broke and later snapped Rickerson's neck with his bare hands.

After the killing, Matt fled to Mexico, where he killed a man outside a bar.

Sweat was doing life without parole for his part in the 2002 killing of sheriff's Deputy Kevin Tarsia, who was shot 15 times and run over after discovering Sweat and two accomplices transferring stolen guns between vehicles.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

6815.0,Culchie Tries To Explain Rules Of 25 One More Time,"0 Add Comment 
RATHER than relax and play Texas Hold ‘Em with his friends as they had a few cans after a recent night out, hardcore culchie Noel Kennelan desperatley attempted to explain the impenetrable rules of the card game ’25’, which he claims is ‘way better than poker, hi’. 
25, also known as ‘that culchie game’, involves the dealing of 5 cards to each player and the reveal of a trump card, followed by at least 10 minutes of explaining how the 2 of spades can beat the 9 of diamonds if spades were lead with, and diamonds aren’t trump. 
Kennelan, 28, made great efforts to explain to the 6 other men around the table of his Dublin flat the baffling rules of ‘stealing’ and ‘reneging’, but in the end had to concede that the game was too complex and the players were too drunk to fully wrap their heads around it.

599.0,Election Day: No Legal Pot In Ohio; Democrats Lose In The South,"Election Day: No Legal Pot In Ohio; Democrats Lose In The South

Tuesday is ""off year"" Election Day in parts of the country. Legalizing marijuana is on the ballot in Ohio, Houston voters will decide on an equal rights ordinance and San Francisco weighs short-term rentals in what's being called the ""Airbnb Initiative.""

Elsewhere, eyes are on governor races in Kentucky and Louisiana, and whether Democrats can make any progress in the South.

Here's a look at some of the races:

Houston voters will decide whether to keep an equal rights ordinance that was approved by the City Council last year. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity — criteria not covered by national anti-discrimination laws. The ordinance is hotly debated, particularly after some opposition ads were released. The ads claim that the ordinance would allow men who identify as women to assault women and young girls in bathrooms.

Hillary Clinton tweeted her support for the ordinance on Oct. 29, writing: ""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love — I support efforts for Equality in Houston & beyond. #HERO #YesOnProp1 -H"".

A White House spokesman said that President Obama and Vice President Biden were ""confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.""

Update from Houston Public Media: Houston's voters strongly rejected the anti-discrimination measure, with about three-fifths of voters opposed.

Republican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway are running to replace retiring Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat. Although Republicans have aggressively been spending money in the hope of retaining the governor's mansion, Conway has outspent Bevin 4 to 1. This race has been characterized by both candidates accusing each other of lying about their records.

Update from WFPL in Louisville: Conway conceded the race — the returns late Tuesday night showed Bevin winning with about 53 percent of the vote — and Republicans generally performed well in the state.

Louisiana has a gubernatorial election this year but it doesn't work the way you might expect. Louisiana's election system relies on what's called a ""jungle primary."" In a jungle primary, all candidates regardless of party appear on one ballot. If no one wins 50 percent of the vote, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election.

John Bel Edwards, a Democrat and state legislative leader, earned roughly 40 percent of the vote. He now will face Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, in the runoff election on Nov. 21. Vitter has had a tough race so far. His critics have continuously cited his involvement in a 2007 prostitution scandal, in which Vitter's telephone number was found in the records of the so-called D.C. Madam, Deborah Palfrey. Palfrey was accused of running a prostitution ring that made more than $2 million over 13 years.

The ""Clean Elections Initiative"" would increase public funding for candidates to up to $3 million in order to make them more competitive against privately-funded candidates, according to Reuters. The existing law makes up to $2 million available to candidates for state office. The ballot measure would also increase disclosure requirements and increase the penalties for campaign finance violations.

Update from the Portland Press Herald: The measure passed, with 55 percent of the vote as of late Tuesday:

Republican Gov. Phil Bryant is up for reelection and faces opposition from an unlikely candidate — truck driver and political unknown Robert Gray. According to The Associated Press, Gray didn't even tell his closest relatives that he had signed up to campaign for governor. Bryant has spent roughly $2.7 million this year and reportedly has $1.4 million in the bank. Gray has spent about $3,000 on his campaign in the past three months.

Update from Mississippi Public Broadcasting: Gray will presumably be back on the road after losing, 67 percent to 32 percent.

Ohio voters vote on two ballot measures with constitutional amendments that could dramatically change marijuana laws in their state. Issue 3, as one of these two measures is called, would enable landowners or operators of 10 predetermined sites the right to grow commercial marijuana. That's in contradiction to the second measure, Issue 2, which would prohibit monopolies from being enshrined in the state constitution. If both measures pass, there's sure to be lots of confusion.

Update from WCPN in Cleveland: Voters rejected legal and medical marijuana, with two-thirds voting against Issue 3; Issue 2, the measure rejecting the proposed marijuana oligopoly, was passing 54 percent to 46 percent.

San Franciscans heading to the polls Tuesday will get to vote on Proposition F, colloquially known as the ""Airbnb Initiative."" The initiative is a ballot measure that would strengthen regulation on the short-term rental of houses and apartments. While Airbnb is likely the biggest company in that niche market, the Los Angeles Times points out that there are other vacation rental companies that would be affected. Right now, residents can rent out their apartment or home for 90 days in a year. Proposition F would limit that rental period to 75 days. The measure is viewed as an attempt to discourage people from taking units off the housing market and using them as short-term apartment rentals. San Francisco has an acute housing shortage.

Update from KQED in San Francisco: Voters rejected the measure, Proposition F, 55 percent to 45 percent.

Seattle voters will decide on a campaign finance measure that's being touted as a national model for campaign finance reform. Ballot initiative I-122, if passed, would create a public financing model in the city. Every resident would receive a $100 voucher to give to the candidate of their choosing. The measure would also limit election campaign contributions from entities receiving city contracts of $250,000 or more, or from people spending more than $5,000 on lobbying.

Update from KUOW in Seattle: Voters overwhelmingly passed the measure, 60 percent to 40 percent.

All 140 seats of Virginia's General Assembly are up for election today. Republicans currently control the state Senate, 21 seats to 19. Expecting low turnout, both parties have been trying to drive their message home to voters. Republicans are expected to retain their majority in the GA. Democrats hope to take control of the state Senate.

Update from the Richmond Times-Dispatch: Republicans have kept their majority in the Senate, and their strong control of the General Assembly.",REAL,election day no legal pot in ohio democrats lose in

4577.0,President Trump: A colossal failure for democracy and our terrifying new reality,"It’s impossible to overstate how colossal a fuckup this is. At every level, across both parties, the media, pollsters — all the democratic institutions that are supposed to prevent something like this from happening or at least warn us about it. Donald Trump, a Republican candidate who ran an openly racist campaign, who is as proud a misogynist as you’ll find anywhere, who is manifestly ignorant of public policy, who is brusquely authoritarian, who has little respect or understanding of democratic norms and who embodies every moral failing that’s supposed to disqualify a candidate from higher office, has apparently been elected as the next president of the United States.

The markets are collapsing, the globe is reeling, and nobody can quite explain what the hell happened. But here’s what this failure will mean: The climate, which is warming precipitously, is now guaranteed to continue along that trajectory toward global catastrophe. The millions of people who gained health coverage over the last half of a decade are now at acute risk of being thrown off their insurance plan and left to the unfeeling mercies of insurance underwriters.

Income inequality, already at dangerously high levels, will only grow worse as tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor are pushed through the Republican Congress. Unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Supreme Court nominees has been rewarded in the worst possible way. And the foreign policy of the United States will be run by a bona fide ignoramus.

The man elected to the most powerful office in the land has no idea what to do with it and no concept of its limitations. He attracts the worst people to him, sycophants and power-hungry strivers who will be placed in positions of authority and who will obey the boss’ diktat above anything else. Every democratic norm he gleefully shredded along the way is gone for good. Every thumb in the eye of transparency will now be official policy.

But right now those things are not what I think about when I contemplate life under President Donald Trump. This will sound trite, but primarily I think about my two boys, a 2-year-old and a 4-month-old. I don’t have to explain this to them because neither would understand. But if I were to tell my 2-year-old what is happening, I’d do it in Spanish because both he and his brother have deep Mexican roots that my wife and I want them to embrace and be proud of. It destroys me to know that they, that we live in a country that seems to have chosen as its leader a person who made frenzied racial attacks on my family’s heritage the launch pad for his successful presidential run. I think about the African-Americans, Muslims, Jews, and Latinos in this country who now face life in a country presided over by a candidate who embodies white nationalism and memorably couldn’t bring himself to disavow a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Children of undocumented immigrants who are U.S. citizens by birth have been told by their new president that they’ll be deported. Refugees from Syria who were relocated here to escape war and violence will have another target on their backs. These are the people who will feel the consequences of this failure most acutely. I have one more thing to add: I am sorry. In my capacity as a media figure, I too often treated Trump as a joke, a bumbling incompetent, someone who obviously could not be treated seriously as a legitimate candidate for the presidency. Now I can only think that I was too hidebound by conventional wisdom, too comfortably out of touch to see what was in front of me. I succumbed to the sideshow element of this awful race more times than I can be comfortable with. I own this failure, too.",REAL,its impossible to overstate how colossal a fuckup this is at every level across both parties the media pollsters  all the democratic institutions that are supposed to

1934.0,Chris Christie losing home-state donors as Jeb Bush makes inroads,"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is rapidly losing support among some of his most prominent home-state donors and power brokers, who are either hesitant to back him or shifting allegiance to former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

Bush’s aggressive moves to lock up the Republican Party’s premier fundraisers threaten to undercut the Garden State governor before his expected campaign can get off the ground, while raising questions about how robust of a network of support Christie will be able to muster.

Bush has stopped short of directly confronting Christie by holding a fundraiser on his home turf. But behind the scenes, he has been quietly wooing, via e-mail, a cadre of high-profile Christie backers, including a group that attended a private dinner with Bush at New York’s Union League Club in January.

“I’ve known and admired Jeb for many years and I’m obviously intrigued by his candidacy, or I wouldn’t have had dinner or communicated with him in recent weeks,” said New Jersey State Sen. Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr. (R), who chaired Christie’s 2009 gubernatorial campaign and attended the New York dinner. “Time will tell how things evolve.”

New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a onetime Christie booster, signaled his support for Bush on Wednesday when he showed up at a fundraiser in Chicago for Bush’s political committees.

Former New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean Sr., a longtime mentor of Christie who is no longer close to him, said in an interview Thursday that he hasn’t decided whom to back — while offering praise for Bush.

“When [Bush] said he has strong views on issues and won’t change them to win an early primary, it showed me he has real convictions,” Kean said. “The Republican Party in the past has had problems with people who changed their views in order to win a primary, only to have to scramble back in a general election. Voters don’t find that kind of behavior credible.”

Several Bush donors in New Jersey are also in the initial stages of planning an event in the state in March or April, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions. Bush may not attend, but his backers want to demonstrate his New Jersey support.

Several top Christie backers said Thursday that he still has a strong organization of financial heavyweights both in New Jersey and across the country, and they disputed the notion that he is being undercut by Bush.

“We’re doing fine,” said Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, who has pledged to devote substantial resources to advance Christie’s bid. “Everybody I’ve called and asked has said yes.”

Christie allies do not expect that he will be able to come close to matching Bush’s current fundraising spree, which is expected to bring in tens of millions. His team has sought to project a sense of calm as it makes daily calls to donors, arguing that much of the movement toward Bush is coming from loyalists who received appointments in the administrations of his father and brother.

Ray Washburne, the Dallas real estate developer leading the national fundraising push for Christie’s political committee, said there is plenty of room for both of them.

“Jeb has grabbed a good bit of the donor base, no question,” he said. “But there is still a huge amount of the donor base available to get.”

A Christie aide provided a list of two dozen New Jersey major contributors committed to Christie’s new political committee, including investor Finn Wentworth, trucking magnate Jerry Langer and Christie’s brother, Todd.

New Jersey real estate executive Jon Hanson, who served as finance chairman for Christie’s gubernatorial campaigns, said his in-state donor network is “stepping up and contributing.”

“I can see he’s out there doing a good job,” Hanson said of Bush. “But I don’t think that’s going to hinder our ability to raise money for Governor Christie’s PAC.”

Last week, Christie held a fundraiser at the Greenwich, Conn., home of former GOP gubernatorial candidate Thomas C. Foley. In the coming weeks, he is planning to headline finance events in California and Texas.

So far, Christie has been raising money solely for his Leadership Matters for America PAC, which can accept up to $5,000 from individual donors. An affiliated super PAC, which can raise unlimited personal and corporate money, is expected to be launched soon.

Once it is, Langone said he plans to put in significant amounts of money. “Absolutely,” he said. “I’m waiting for it to start.”

But the investor also noted that he would be squarely behind Bush if Christie’s Florida rival emerges victorious out of the GOP primaries.

“If Jeb Bush is the Republican nominee, I will do everything I can to help him get elected,” he said. “Jeb Bush is a good man. My preference is Christie for one reason: As I look at what this country desperately needs, I think he comes closest to giving us everything we need and want.”

The reticence Christie has encountered among prominent party financiers is a sharp contrast with the more than $100 million that the Republican Governors Association brought in under his recent chairmanship. While Christie aides have credited the fundraising haul to his efforts, some RGA donors have privately said their giving was driven more by their interest in supporting various governors up for reelection.

Christie’s difficulty in locking down home-state support comes after his remarks about child vaccinations on a recent trip to London drew a wave of scathing criticism and alarmed some of his supporters. The governor had to make a series of calls to assure contributors that he supports vaccination for diseases such as measles.

Spencer Zwick, Mitt Romney’s finance chairman in 2012, said the attitude of former Christie backers at home is telling.

“Kyrillos is a very good bellwether for what’s happening in New Jersey,” Zwick said of the state senator. “If Christie decides to run, he’s going to need the support from the people closest to him to sustain him until he can get national Republican support.”

Zwick, who has not committed to a 2016 candidate, added, “Personally, I have had my own reservations about what Governor Christie did at a key moment in the last presidential election and let it be known to him and others,” a reference to extensive public praise by Christie of President Obama for the federal response to Hurricane Sandy in the late stages of the campaign. “But I do not believe he had bad intentions and I have moved on.”

Another former Christie ally, New Jersey attorney Lawrence E. Bathgate II, hosted the Jan. 8 dinner in New York to introduce Bush to some of Christie’s top supporters.

Bathgate had been in Christie’s camp for years, but their relationship publicly soured after Christie’s administration pursued a plan to build protective dunes on the state’s coastline where Bathgate has an oceanfront home.

In an interview, though, Bathgate said his reservations about Christie began when he embraced Obama during his visit to the hurricane-battered state. He also expressed concern about more recent events, including the ongoing inquiry into the closing of traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge.

“I know he wanted to work with President Obama on Sandy, but that doesn’t mean you have to put your arm around him and hug him,” said Bathgate, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. “That took the election and Mitt Romney off the front page. Then you see him a couple years later flying around on Jerry Jones’s jet, jumping up and down like he is a seventh grader. He’s going to have to answer for all of that, and for Bridgegate.”",REAL,new jersey gov chris christie is rapidly losing support among some of his most prominent homestate donors and power brokers who

9557.0,Washington Home Depot store receives order for five-thousand gallons of gold exterior paint,"Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Washington Home Depot store receives order for five-thousand gallons of gold exterior paint 
The Washington DC branch of the famous chain of home improvement superstores received an unusual and baffling phone call late last night. 
Store manager Chuck Williams told reporters, “We received a telephone call just before closing last night from a very excited gentleman, placing an order for over $120,000 worth of gold concrete paint.” 
He continued “It was quite a hurried conversation, and I couldn’t catch everything he said, but I did hear the caller say something cryptic about turning a white house gold. 
“I honestly have no idea what he could have meant, perhaps it was a riddle. And weirdly he kept referring to himself in the third person. 
“At first we thought it might have been a hoax or someone out of their head on mind-altering substances, but we have checked our account and the money is already there, so we will start fulfilling the order immediately.” 
When pressed by reporters, Mr Williams was reluctant to give further details for fear of breaching customer confidentiality, but he did confirm that the order was for a residence on Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C 20500. 
He added, “I don’t know who this caller who referred to himself as ‘The Big Cheese’ could be, but he sure loves gold.” Get the best NewsThump stories in your mailbox every Friday, for FREE!

5297.0,Western Lynch Mob on Russia Ties Itself up in Absurd Anots      : Information," Western Lynch Mob on Russia Ties Itself up in Absurd Knots By Finian Cunningham
October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" RT "" - The Western lynch mob-like campaign to get Russia goes on, with the gathering this week of the United Nations Human Rights Council. By trying to suspend Russia from the council, the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize. The 47-member UNHRC, based in Geneva, is the United Nations premier inter-governmental forum on human rights. Members are selected on a rotational basis. On Friday, 14 seats on the council are up for renewal.
This week 80 mainly Western non-governmental organizations associated with human rights reportedly urged the UNHRC to drop Russias membership, citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Over 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria https://t.co/uKTfWXWOLn
 RT (@RT_com) 24 октября 2016 г. Among the anti-Russia lobby were US-based and George Soros-funded Human Rights Watch. Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia.
The campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain  also a member of the council  convened a summit in Geneva. The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces.
Russias permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkin rebuked the UNHRC for a one-sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria. He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and France, along with Gulf Arab states, which lobbied for the resolution.
Radar data proves Belgian F-16s attacked village near Aleppo, killing 6 - Russian military https://t.co/Aj8mgT39ri pic.twitter.com/XHU4ljZb4H
 RT (@RT_com) 20 октября 2016 г. These states have been arming and funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011. They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country  in the name of fighting terrorism  which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes.
In recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties.
So, of course, Western-orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality.
The contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug-abuse charges, or the pseudo-probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe. We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligence agencies that Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next month.
Saudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council https://t.co/sqWeSwjg48 #UNHR #SaudiArabia #humanrights
 RT (@RT_com) 27 октября 2016 г. The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia.
Perhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats.
That Saudi Arabia  widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth  is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat, according to documents released last year by WikiLeaks.
A Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes. Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen. It is also well documented that US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes. That makes these Western states fully complicit.
Moscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F-16s bombing of Syrian civilians https://t.co/WzwvworaZd pic.twitter.com/cHlKvzaeUD
 RT (@RT_com) 21 октября 2016 г. Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years, according to a report last week.
Britain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, has sold over $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015. Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots to help train Saudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law.
There is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC.
The hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void.
Importantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications.
The information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources. Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by activist groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported rescue workers of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center.
BREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into #Aleppo war crimes https://t.co/xrdojTxO3v pic.twitter.com/2gKhTiMovH
 RT (@RT_com) 21 октября 2016 г. In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda.Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called Free Syria broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat.
Free Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy. It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks.
Free Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS. Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans.
Another regular contributor to the images and reports on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. Thus, on this publicly available Free Syria channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam.
What is even more damning is that the same  information is disseminated  albeit in a more polished form  through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian.
Its an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted. Russias military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state. That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies.
And to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies.

5075.0,Can Sanders rally supporters around Clinton after DNC email leak?,"Bernie Sanders has thrown his support behind Hilary Clinton, but it remains to be seen whether his base will follow his lead.

Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, (I) of Vermont, march during a protest in downtown on Sunday, in Philadelphia. The Democratic National Convention starts Monday in Philadelphia.

Amid lingering angst over the primary process, Bernie Sanders has a chance to encourage his supporters to embrace party unity.

Sanders is set to meet privately with supporters Monday before the start of the Democratic National Convention. Sanders backers have expressed frustration over the nominating procedures, the party platform and party leadership, with some suggesting they may protest or take action on the floor. But the Vermont Senator has struck a positive message in recent interviews, expressing his support for Hillary Clinton.

""I'm proud that, in the Democratic platform that was passed a few weeks ago, we are making some real progress,"" Sanders said on CNN Sunday. He added: ""My focus right now is defeating (Donald) Trump, electing Clinton, electing progressive candidates around this country and focusing on the issues that matter the most to working families.""

Efforts to promote party togetherness were not helped by the publication last week of thousands of hacked emails, some of which suggested the DNC was favoring Clinton during the primary season. For many Sanders fans, the messages proved that their concerns about party officials preferring Clinton were correct. While party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down soon, she will still have a convention role, which could draw jeers from Sanders delegates.

""Democrats had great fun chortling over last week’s less-than-smooth Republican convention – the 'Never Trump' revolt, the plagiarism, the booing, the high-profile GOP no-shows,"" The Christian Science Monitor's Linda Feldmann reports. ""Now, it appears that Donald Trump and the Republicans may have the last laugh, as thousands of pro-Sanders demonstrators descend upon Philadelphia to protest the Democratic establishment – including Clinton’s perceived deficits as a progressive.""

At a meeting of the DNC credentials committee Sunday, comments praising Wasserman Schultz were met with laughter by some Sanders supporters. At a committee meeting the previous day, Sanders backers shouted ""shame, shame, shame"" as amendments to abolish or limit superdelegates in future nominating competitions were voted down.

Some Sanders delegates feel the Clinton campaign is not taking their policy concerns seriously. At a news conference Sunday, Sanders delegate Norman Solomon, 65, of Point Reyes Station, California, said many of Sanders' liberal supporters were disappointed in Clinton's vice presidential pick of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. He said most viewed Kaine as not progressive enough and that there had been discussion about a variety of protest actions at the convention, including walking out.

""We've got to challenge the corporate power in the Democratic Party represented by Hillary Clinton today,"" Solomon said.

Still, Sanders delegate Courtney Rowe, 34, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said ""we are not here to disrupt for the purpose of disruption."" She said she was not currently planning on any action and wanted to hear from Sanders.

Sanders, who endorsed Clinton two weeks ago after a long-fought primary, has sought to find common ground around the party platform and rules. He successfully won major platform concessions, including a $15 federal minimum wage, abolishing the death penalty and breaking up large Wall Street banks. And at the DNC rules committee the two sides agreed on a ""unity commission"" that will review changes to the nominating process, including limiting the role of superdelegates.

After the unity commission agreement, Sanders supporters seeking to pass amendments to abolish or curtail superdelegates opted against pursuing convention floor fights on the issue.

Sanders has made clear that he would like to see a full roll call vote at the convention, so that his delegates can show their support.",REAL,bernie sanders has thrown his support behind hilary

4714.0,"Trump slams 'corrupt' media, as more women make sexual assault claims","Two more women accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault Friday, with a relative of one of them saying that the allegation was ""an attempt to regain the spotlight.""



Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's NBC reality show ""The Apprentice,"" said the real estate mogul kissed her and groped her after meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007 to discuss a potential job. Zervos, accompanied at a Los Angeles press conference by attorney Gloria Allred, said she was later offered a lower-paying job at a Trump golf course.

“You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star,” Zervos said at the press conference, addressing Trump.

Late Friday, the Trump campaign released a statement purporting to be from statement in which a cousin of Zervos said he was ""shocked and bewildered"" by her account.

John Barry of Mission Viejo, Calif., said in the statement that Zervos spoke glowingly of Trump until the real estate mogul rebuffed an invitation to visit her restaurant during the primary campaign.

""I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she’s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump,"" Barry said. ""That’s not how she talked about him before.""

Trump himself issued a statement saying that he ""never met [Zervos] at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I’ve conducted my life."" He added that Zervos had emailed Trump's office this past April 14 to ask if he could visit her restaurant in California.

Allred, who frequently represents women bringing sexual harassment and assault claims, said “many more women” have contacted her regarding the Republican nominee after a video emerged of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005 – comments Trump apologized for, but dismissed as “locker room talk.”

Allred said Zervos is not filing a suit at this time.

Earlier Friday, The Washington Post reported on a woman’s claim that Trump put his hand up her skirt and groped her at a Manhattan nightspot in the early '90s.

According to the Post, Kristin Anderson claimed that while she was at the Manhattan nightspot in the early 1990s, Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt and fondled her.

Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks called Anderson's claim a ""total fabrication."" She said in a statement, ""It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan.""

The new allegations capped a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Trump, who has faced a daily drip-drip of allegations even as he has tried to focus on Bill Clinton's female accusers -- and the massive leak of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks.

As Zervos was making her accusations Friday, Trump was at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., rejecting all the allegations against him as “total fiction.”

“I have no idea who these women are,” Trump said. “The stories are total fiction. They’re 100 percent made up.”

He continued to expand on his argument that the claims are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he calls “the corrupt media” – in particular the New York Times, which kick-started the reports of sexual misconduct earlier this week. Trump previously threatened to sue the Times over allegations they published from two women who claim Trump groped them.

On Friday, Trump went after the Times again, suggesting the reporters were acting at the behest of billionaire Carlos Slim, the largest shareholder in the Times.

“Now, Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He’s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives,” Trump said. “Reporters at The New York Times, they’re not journalists. They’re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.”

Trump then claimed the controversy was “a total setup” consisting of “lies spread by the media” as a way to undermine his campaign. He went so far as to mock his accusers, making fun of one who told the Times he groped her on an airplane in the early 1980s.

“The only way they can figure they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say ‘Oh I was with Donald Trump in 1980,’” he said, putting on a voice mocking his accusers. “'I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane.’ Yeah, I'm gonna go after you…”

“Believe me,” he added. “She would not be my first choice, I can tell you.”

One of the accusers who came forward earlier this week, Mindy McGillivray of Palm Springs, Fla., told the Palm Beach Post Friday that she was planning to leave the United States because she feared for her family’s safety. She told the paper cars had been driving around her house.

As Trump ratched up his attacks Friday on the media and his accusers, Democrats have been seizing on the accounts as proof that Trump is unfit for office. On Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama launched a scathing attack on the billionaire and the comments he made on the 2005 tape.

""We have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime, over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are shocking, so demeaning,"" she said. ""I simply will not repeat anything here today. Last week, we actually saw this candidate bragging about sexually assaulting women. I can't believe I'm saying that, a candidate for president of the United States bragged about sexually assaulting women.""

On Friday, President Obama followed up, saying Trump was determined to “drag this election as low as he can possibly go” and warned that “democracy is on the ballot” in November.

6176.0,Only Demented Imbeciles Want A Killary Reign Of Terror,"in: Government Corruption , Special Interests , US News The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati’s masters of the universe require to purge the “Little People” from the planet. Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the “Politically Correct” secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante’s Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for “The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment” or Level 8- the Malebolge where “The magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves”. Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the ‘CLINTON DEATH LIST’: 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse, who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche”. Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, “Let them eat cake” but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the “Little People”. The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. “Her problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn’t know where to draw the line. As far as she’s concerned, “justice” for the fate of her family isn’t just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the “extermination” of all of the Marquis’s family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!” (3.12.36). “It was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.” (3.14.33) So it comes as no surprise that when “The meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn’t even stop knitting.” This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist’s warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option. Citizens will not be the only people voting. Non eligible people are being ushered into a ballot booth with predisposed programming to put Killary into the oval office. The establishment is revealing their real tyranny for any person, who is still alive and has the ability to assess the actual nature of this election. The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton’s attempt to hide her family’s pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold. Thanks to the Wikileaks release of the illicit emails from the Clinton cabal, only a fool can vote for her. Come to grips with the prospects of knowingly elevating this lifelong criminal to become the commander-and-chief. Genuine national security cannot be scarified to allow a distrustful and compromised agent of foreign interests to become President. Killary is dead meat. She could never gain the confidence of the nation and her continued nihilistic conduct and her kleptocrat criminal violations cannot be tolerated or ignored any longer. If you really want to save the planet, you cannot cast your ballot for this known traitor.",FAKE,in government corruption  special interests  us news the cross section of hillary clinton voters is a

Americans Are So Disconnected From Reality That “Insouciant” Has Become An Euphemism 
While the idiot presstitutes and their brainwashed victims hyper-ventilate about Trump’s lewd talk about women, one consequence of the ignored nuclear arms race restarted by the neoconservatives, who have been in charge of US foreign policy in the 21st century, is the Russian Satan 2, which is reported to be capable of destroying the entirety of a land mass the size of Texas or France with one hit. 
The neoconservative foreign policy that has produced this result is obviously a total failure and endangers all life on earth. Hillary Clinton is a representative of this disastrous foreign policy. If Americans and Europeans cannot put into office people who can get along with Russia, there is no future for anyone. Trump is the only one who says he sees no point in conflict with Russia. This is what is important, not lewd talk about women. 
Hillary’s lewd talk about Putin –“the new Hitler”–will get us all killed.

4911.0,The 5 unspoken rules for covering Hillary Clinton,"The reporter's job is to ""comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable"" — a credo that, humorously, was originally written as a smear of the self-righteous nature of journalists. And so the justification for going after a public figure increases in proportion to his or her stature. The bigger the figure, the looser the restraints.

After a quarter of a century on the national stage, there's no more comfortable political figure to afflict than Hillary Clinton. And she's in for a lot of affliction over the next year and half.

That's generally a good way for reporters to go about their business. After all, the more power a person wants in our republic, the more voters should know about her or him. But it's also an essential frame for thinking about the long-toxic relationship between the Clintons and the media, why the coverage of Hillary Clinton differs from coverage of other candidates for the presidency, and whether that difference encourages distortions that will ultimately affect the presidential race.

The Clinton rules are driven by reporters' and editors' desire to score the ultimate prize in contemporary journalism: the scoop that brings down Hillary Clinton and her family's political empire. At least in that way, Republicans and the media have a common interest.

I understand these dynamics well, having co-written a book that demonstrated how Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary's time at State to build the family political operation and set up for their fourth presidential campaign. That is to say, I've done a lot of research about the Clintons' relationship with the media, and experienced it firsthand. As an author, I felt that I owed it to myself and the reader to report, investigate, and write with the same mix of curiosity, skepticism, rigor, and compassion that I would use with any other subject. I wanted to sell books, of course. But the easier way to do that — proven over time — is to write as though the Clintons are the purest form of evil. The same holds for daily reporting. Want to drive traffic to a website? Write something nasty about a Clinton, particularly Hillary.

As a reporter, I get sucked into playing by the Clinton rules. This is what I've seen in my colleagues, and in myself.

One of my former colleagues, a hard-nosed reporter who has put countless political pelts on his wall, once told me that everyone in public life has something to hide. Who goes down in the flames of scandal? The politicians we decide to go after.

That may not be 100 percent true, but it's true enough. The act of choosing, time and again, to go after the same person has the effect of tainting that person, even when an investigation or reporting turns up nothing nefarious — and it's time not spent digging into his or her adversaries. The original source of alleged malfeasance could come from the other party, within a politician's party, or from the reporter's own observations and industrious digging. But two things are crystal clear: If there's no investigation, there's no scandal. And if there's no scandal, there's no scalp.

The Clintons have been under investigation for about 25 years now. There's little doubt they've produced more information for investigators, lawyers, and journalists about their finances, their business and philanthropic dealings, and their decision-making processes in government than any officials in American history. They've watched countless friends frog-marched into congressional hearings and, in some cases, to jail. They know there's a good chance that any expressed thought will become part of the public record and twisted for political gain.

The most absurd allegations against Hillary Clinton have been bookends on her public career so far: that she had something to do with the suicide of Clinton White House aide Vince Foster, and that she bears responsibility for the terrorist attack that killed US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens.

But in between, there was Travelgate, Filegate, and Whitewater. Some were less legitimate than others. When Clinton surprisingly claimed that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House, it was because they had spent all of their money to defend themselves against an eight-year barrage of investigations.

It's understandable, then, why the Clintons have a bunker mentality when it comes to transparency. But their paranoia leads them to be secretive, and their secrecy leads Republicans and the press to suspect wrongdoing. That spurs further investigation, which only makes the Clintons more secretive. The paranoia and persistent investigation feed each other in an endless cycle of probe and parry. Along the way, the political class and the public are forced to choose imperfect sides: the power couple that always seems to be hiding something, or a Washington investigation complex that is overly partisan and underwhelming in its ability to prove gross misconduct.

This is, for Republicans, a reasonable strategy. They know that if they keep investigating her, it will do two things: keep the media writing about scandals that might knock her out, and turn off voters who don't want a return to the bloodsport politics of the 1990s. They leak partial stories to reporters hungry for that one great scoop that will give them the biggest political scalp of them all. But they also err in jumping the gun in accusing her of wrongdoing, which allows Clinton to defend herself by pointing at the folly of her adversaries.

In touring the country to promote our book in 2014, my co-author and I were repeatedly lobbied to assert that Clinton is a lesbian. One gentleman pushed the issue during a Q&A at a Barnes and Noble on the Upper West Side of Manhattan — one of the few places you might expect that kind of thing to get a rest.

The National Enquirer published a story in April alleging that Clinton wiped her personal email server clean because it contained references to her lesbian lovers.

Meanwhile, the conservative media are also convinced Clinton is preparing to wage a war on Christianity if she wins the presidency. But one thing revealed in her State Department emails is that Clinton shared daily religious reflections with her friends.

It's not just the out-of-the-box allegations that keep the media machine spun up. A year before Chelsea Clinton got married, Clinton staffers were kept busy by mainstream journalists who were absolutely sure she had already gone through with secret nuptials.

And, on a more serious note, remember Benghazi flu? Many political opponents and members of the media were unable to accept the idea that Clinton was forced to cancel planned Senate testimony on Benghazi because she'd suffered a concussion. Now, three years later, it seems ridiculous to think that Clinton was making an excuse — she's since testified on both sides of the Hill — or that she suffered, as Karl Rove suggested, brain damage. And if she was making up the concussion to avoid testifying, how did she suffer brain damage from a fake fall?

The conservative media echo chamber, which bounces innuendo from Rush Limbaugh to Fox News and back again, ensures that the most damning story lines — true or not — stay alive. The Benghazi attacks are a perfect example. Terrorists killed four Americans. The conservative echo chamber seems convinced Hillary Clinton is at fault. The reasonable argument to make is that we shouldn't have been in Libya in the first place and the murders were a down-the-chain result of bad policy. But the right wing wants to prove that they happened because of Clinton's actions — or inaction — on security matters.

They've talked about security requests denied for Libya (never mind that the stronger contingent would have been in Tripoli, not Benghazi, and that there's no evidence Clinton herself was aware of the requests), a stand-down order that prevented reinforcements from arriving in Benghazi (never mind that they wouldn't have gotten there until after the fighting was done, and that even a House Republican committee found that there was no such order) and, most of absurd of all, that Clinton knew the attack was coming. This is how Limbaugh put it in May.

The freedom of the conservative media to make wild allegations often acts as a bulldozer forcing reporters to check into the charges and, in doing so, repeat them. By the time they've been debunked, they're part of the American public's collective consciousness. Or, as it's been said, a lie gets around the world before the truth gets out of bed.

One outgrowth of Clinton's terrible relationship with reporters is that journalists often assume she is acting in bad faith. There's good reason for that. Though she's added some new pros to her press staff for this campaign, her operation's stance toward the media was always a reflection of the way Bill Clinton's White House handled journalists.

Back in the mid-1990s, Bill Clinton relied on a series of Machiavellian spin doctors to keep the press at bay. With the Clinton White House, the modus operandi was to stonewall as long as possible, lie if necessary — or just out of habit — and turn questions around on the questioners. After all, Bill Clinton once wagged his finger at a press conference and told reporters, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Ms. Lewinsky."" He'd lied in a deposition, too.

So the press has plenty of precedent for believing that when the Clintons aren't forthcoming — and sometimes, even when they are — they're covering something up. And the Clintons, given the history of some-smoke-no-fire investigations launched against them, have plenty of precedent for being mistrustful of the press. The result is a brutally dysfunctional relationship on both sides. The Clintons believe the press acts in bad faith, and the press believes the Clintons' attitudes toward the press are evidence that the Clintons are hiding something.

That attitude carried over to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, and to some degree her tenure as Secretary of State. The standard response to a reporter's question is not an answer. It is to ignore the question or to engage in a Socratic debate by asking a question in return. It's clear Clinton doesn't like the media one bit, as Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman reported last year.

At a July Fourth parade this past weekend, Clinton aides used rope to create an impromptu moving barrier for reporters, keeping them away from the candidate and voters. She treated them like cattle, and they responded by putting the video on television for the last three days.

The mistrust among journalists is a problem for Clinton. And as the media is an amplifier for the public, it's also little wonder that so many voters are inclined to believe she's often acting in bad faith. Most Americans say she's not honest and trustworthy.

This view, shared by many reporters and most of the public, makes it much easier to treat Clinton's actions as though they are uniquely sinister. Case in point: She made a ton of money giving paid speeches to people with business before the government. So did Jeb Bush, of course. But until Bush recently released an accounting of some of those speeches, the media had little interest in his dealings. Kudos to Ken Vogel of Politico, who did some digging on that for a story published Thursday.

The imbalance in assumptions about Clinton's motivations is another way in which the Clinton code has a distorting effect on the public perception of her. And it, too, is self-perpetuating: It leads Clinton to assume the press is biased against her, which leads her to treat the press poorly, which leads more reporters to assume she's trying to hide something from them.

When Clinton keynoted an annual fundraiser for David Axelrod's epilepsy charity in June 2013, several major news outlets sent reporters to cover the speech. That was more than three years before the 2016 election. Every word, every gesture, every facial expression is scrutinized.

Video of Clinton ordering a burrito bowl at a Chipotle became the first viral image of her campaign. Reporters gave fodder to late-night comedians earlier this year when they made a mad dash to catch up as her campaign van rolled by.

This coverage of every last detail, of course, isn't a one-way street. It wasn't until a reporter was tipped off to the Chipotle visit that anyone knew about it. She craves the attention even more than she detests it.

But that, too, has a distorting effect. As with the royal family in London, normally private moments become part of a public narrative: her husband's affair, her daughter's wedding, the birth of her granddaughter.

All the attention has the effect of making Clinton seem, to the casual observer, hungrier for press than even the average politician. And there's no doubt that part of the love/hate relationship is an intense desire to attract and manipulate coverage. But Clinton understands that sometimes it's better not to be in the spotlight.

The best example of that was when she declined requests to appear on Sunday political talk shows right after the Benghazi attacks. Susan Rice, then the ambassador to the UN and now Obama's national security adviser, leaped at the chance to stand in for Clinton. Those appearances ended up costing Rice the nomination to succeed Clinton as secretary of state when many senators concluded she had lied about the origin and nature of the attacks.

The press has such fascination with the Clintons that the coverage would be there whether Hillary Clinton wanted it or not.

For someone who lost a big lead in the 2008 presidential primary and is ceding ground to Bernie Sanders right now, Clinton is given a lot of credit for her political acumen. Her detractors see in every move, including the birth of her granddaughter, a grandly conceived and executed political calculation.

And Clinton plays into that by using the positives in her life for political gain.

That doesn't make her different from other candidates for the presidency — it makes her just like them. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie talked about his grandmothers, his mom, his wife, and his kids when he launched his bid for the presidency last week. Was that calculated to send messages about Christie to the public? Of course!

The best example, though, was the tear — the one that rolled down Clinton's cheek as she campaigned in New Hampshire after having come in third in the Iowa caucuses in 2008.

The New York Times's Maureen Dowd pilloried her for what Dowd saw as a window into the dark part of Clinton's soul.

How far political journalism has come from castigating Ed Muskie for crying to accusing Clinton of calculating that tears would help her win. She's not that good at politics.

I take a dim view of the idea that journalists successfully anoint political winners. The media might have been in the bag for Barack Obama, but he didn't win because he got positive coverage. He won because he had better strategy, a better message, and better skills at delivering that message — in the 2008 primary and in the two general elections he won.

That said, the media can definitely weigh down — and even destroy — a candidate. The emphasis on a candidate's flaws — real or perceived — comes at the cost of the candidate's ability to focus his or her message and at the cost of negative attention to the other candidates. This is a problem for Clinton, and it seems unlikely to go away.

Hillary Clinton is comfortable enough to be a target for a lot of journalistic affliction and powerful enough that no one needs to comfort her from that affliction. But these double standards are an important factor to keep in mind when judging her against her rivals for the presidency. Whether they're fair or not, the Clinton rules distort the public's perception of Hillary Clinton.

Correction: This story has been corrected to remove an erroneous reference to the source of the original report on the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The Drudge Report first broke news that Newsweek had decided to hold a story about the affair.",REAL,the reporters job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable  a credo that humorously

sexual relations with that woman  ms lewinsky hed lied in a deposition too so the press has plenty of precedent for believing that when the clintons arent forthcoming  and sometimes even when they are  theyre covering something up and the clintons given the history of somesmokenofire investigations launched against them have plenty of precedent for being mistrustful of the press the result is a brutally dysfunctional relationship on both sides the clintons believe the press acts in bad faith and the press believes the clintons attitudes toward the press are evidence that the clintons are hiding something that attitude carried over to hillary clintons  campaign and to some degree her tenure as secretary of state the standard response to a reporters question is not an answer it is to ignore the question or to engage in a socratic debate by asking a question in return its clear clinton doesnt like the media one bit as glenn thrush and maggie haberman reported last year at a july fourth parade this past weekend clinton aides used rope to create an impromptu moving barrier for reporters keeping them away from the candidate and voters she treated them like cattle and they responded by putting the video on television for the last three days the mistrust among journalists is a problem for clinton and as the media is an amplifier for the public its also little wonder that so many voters are inclined to believe shes often acting in bad faith most americans say shes not honest and trustworthy this view shared by many reporters and most of the public makes it much easier to treat clintons actions as though they are uniquely sinister case in point she made a ton of money giving paid speeches to people with business before the government so did jeb bush of course but until bush recently released an accounting of some of those speeches the media had little interest in his dealings kudos to ken vogel of politico who did some digging on that for a story published thursday the imbalance in assumptions about clintons motivations is another way in which the clinton code has a distorting effect on the public perception of her and it too is selfperpetuating it leads clinton to assume the press is biased against her which leads her to treat the press poorly which leads more reporters to assume shes trying to hide something from them when clinton keynoted an annual fundraiser for david axelrods epilepsy charity in june  several major news outlets sent reporters to cover the speech that was more than three years before the  election every word every gesture every facial expression is scrutinized video of clinton ordering a burrito bowl at a chipotle became the first viral image of her campaign reporters gave fodder to latenight comedians earlier this year when they made a mad dash to catch up as her campaign van rolled by this coverage of every last detail of course isnt a oneway street it wasnt until a reporter was tipped off to the chipotle visit that anyone knew about it she craves the attention even more than she detests it but that too has a distorting effect as with the royal family in london normally private moments become part of a public narrative her husbands affair her daughters wedding the birth of her granddaughter all the attention has the effect of making clinton seem to the casual observer hungrier for press than even the average politician and theres no doubt that part of the lovehate relationship is an intense desire to attract and manipulate coverage but clinton understands that sometimes its better not to be in the spotlight the best example of that was when she declined requests to appear on sunday political talk shows right after the benghazi attacks susan rice then the ambassador to the un and now obamas national security adviser leaped at the chance to stand in for clinton those appearances ended up costing rice the nomination to succeed clinton as secretary of state when many senators concluded she had lied about the origin and nature of the attacks the press has such fascination with the clintons that the coverage would be there whether hillary clinton wanted it or not for someone who lost a big lead in the  presidential primary and is ceding ground to bernie sanders right now clinton is given a lot of credit for her political acumen her detractors see in every move including the birth of her granddaughter a grandly conceived and executed political calculation and clinton plays into that by using the positives in her life for political gain that doesnt make her different from other candidates for the presidency  it makes her just like them new jersey gov chris christie talked about his grandmothers his mom his wife and his kids when he launched his bid for the presidency last week was that calculated to send messages about christie to the public of course the best example though was the tear  the one that rolled down clintons cheek as she campaigned in new hampshire after having come in third in the iowa caucuses in  the new york timess maureen dowd pilloried her for what dowd saw as a window into the dark part of clintons soul how far political journalism has come from castigating ed muskie for crying to accusing clinton of calculating that tears would help her win shes not that good at politics i take a dim view of the idea that journalists successfully anoint political winners the media might have been in the bag for barack obama but he didnt win because he got positive coverage he won because he had better strategy a better message and better skills at delivering that message  in the  primary and in the two general elections he won that said the media can definitely weigh down  and even destroy  a candidate the emphasis on a candidates flaws  real or perceived  comes at the cost of the candidates ability to focus his or her message and at the cost of negative attention to the other candidates this is a problem for clinton and it seems unlikely to go away hillary clinton is comfortable enough to be a target for a lot of journalistic affliction and powerful enough that no one needs to comfort her from that affliction but these double standards are an important factor to keep in mind when judging her against her rivals for the presidency whether theyre fair or not the clinton rules distort the publics perception of hillary clinton

Hillary Clinton’s campaign is imploding, and it’s so bad that she was caught having a mini meltdown after her press conference as she tried to explain this new email investigation by the FBI, thanks to Anthony Weiner’s laptop. As Hillary lost it, her campaign was caught red-handed, doing dirty tricks to pictures, and you’ll love just how desperate they have become as they see this election sinking like the Titanic. 
Rumors are flying after Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bomb dropped on her campaign, that thousands of government emails are on Anthony Weiner’s laptop. Everyone knows Hillary should have been indicted before, and she had a meltdown of sorts when Kristen Welker of Fox News asked, “Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton?” 
While Hillary was walking away from the short press conference after the Weiner email story broke, she stopped and threw her head back and let out a creepy maniacal laugh . Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin found it really weird, saying it was like Hillary had lost it. She described Hillary “stopping and throwing her head back and laughing, it was really odd.” ""Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,"" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. 
— Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 
However, Hillary Clinton was not really laughing. That was a public meltdown, and she is pissed off that an idiot like Anthony Weiner just cost her this election. It’s so bad that the Clinton campaign was caught photoshopping the crowd at a recent Ohio rally, where Bill Clinton spoke. Bill Clinton rally Oct. 29th, red arrow shows a man (left) who was duplicated in photoshopped pic put out by Clinton campaign, indicated with red circles (right) 
Then, if all of that isn’t bad enough, the Chicago Tribune, one of the most liberal papers in the country, had this headline yesterday: “ Democrats Should Ask Hillary To Step Down ,” which was written by John Kass who was speaking from Hillary’s real home state of Illinois. 
“FBI director James Comey ‘s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign. That he announced this so close to Election Day should tell every thinking person that what the FBI is looking at is extremely serious .” [via Chicago Tribune ] 
If we are agreeing with the Chicago Tribune, you know what happened on Friday with James Comey and the FBI is so devastating that this election is over for Hillary. However, that doesn’t mean we can let up and sigh with relief just yet. 
However, we can be extremely optimistic that, after eight years and two elections that caused utter destruction for our country, we have an extremely good chance that Americans will reject Hillary and her criminal cabal. America was saved by Anthony Weiner, and it doesn’t get any stranger than that.",FAKE,hillary melts down over weiner in public pics prove campaign is imploding posted on october   by rebecca diserio

10555.0,Clinton Vs. Trump: Latest Electoral Prediction [Greg Laden's Blog] | Science and Technology,"(Before It's News)
It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don’t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I’d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn’t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I’ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year’s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can’t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people’s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump’s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I’m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I’d like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat’s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I’m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called “reasonable Republicans” (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here’s the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the “swing states” according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.",FAKE,before its news it is fun to look at polls and using such data decide which candidate

8549.0,Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment?,"Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20. Following Judgment? page: 1 Jesus to St Faustina: You will prepare the world for My final coming. (Diary 429) Speak to the world about My mercy ... It is a sign for the end times. After it will come the Day of Justice. While there is still time, let them have recourse to the fountain of My mercy. (Diary 848) Tell souls about this great mercy of Mine, because the awful day, the day of My justice, is near. (Diary 965). I am prolonging the time of mercy for the sake of sinners. But woe to them if they do not recognize this time of My visitation. (Diary 1160) Before the Day of Justice, I am sending the Day of Mercy. (Diary 1588) He who refuses to pass through the door of My mercy must pass through the door of My justice. (Diary 1146). The Jubilee Year of Mercy proclaimed by pope Francis, ends on November 20th the feast of Christ the King the end of the liturgical year. Every jubilee year is destined to end of course, that's why it is a year and not a decade.But...isn't it too much prophecy gathered in that last year? First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. ""Nothing happened, again"" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell. Time that runs out, according to Anguera and other apparitions of Virgin Mary. That doesn't mean it has all to happen on December 1st. Every next week draws us closer to the two doors, one of which is the Door of Mercy and the other the Door of Justice. Your take on recent catholic prophecy?

2834.0,Iraq launches operation against ISIS in Anbar province,"The Iraqi government -- supported by Shiite militias from Iran -- launched a large-scale military operation to take out Islamic State militants from Iraq’s western Anbar province Monday.

The operation is under way to recapture Fallujah and Ramadi, a senior defense official at the Pentagon confirmed to Fox News Monday. The efforts are supported by Shiite militias, known as Popular Mobilization Units, from Iran and its proxy Hezbollah.

Photos of Iran’s Quds force Commander Qasem Soleimani visiting Shia militia units inside Iraq have appeared on social media since ISIS took over large portions of Iraq a year ago.

The defense official was unaware of any U.S. air support boosting the operation. It has been longstanding Pentagon policy to support only units aligned with the government of Iraq, but the line can be blurred as the chain of command for units operating in Iraq is not always known.

The spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, said in a televised statement that the operation started at dawn Monday and that government forces are backed by Shiite and Sunni pro-government fighters.

The operation met fierce resistance from insurgents, who deployed five suicide car bombs and fired rockets to repel their advance on the city of Fallujah, about 30 miles west of Baghdad, military sources in Anbar told Reuters.

There were also reports of fighting around the provincial capital Ramadi, captured by Islamic State two months ago.

There were also reports of fighting around Ramadi-- captured by Islamic State two months ago. Iraqi forces pushed towards the provincial capital from the west and the south, police sources in the province said. Islamic State supporters said those advances were repelled by the militants.

When Shia militia units launched an operation to retake another Sunni stronghold, Tikrit, in March, they did so without support from the U.S.-led coalition initially.  U.S. warplanes only supported the operation when the Shia militia units backed by Iran departed the area.

According to the latest coalition airstrike report, there were two airstrikes in Fallujah over the weekend.

This is not the first time the Iraqi government has announced an operation to retake Anbar -- where several key towns, including the provincial capital Ramadi, remain under ISIS control. In May, authorities announced an operation to retake Ramadi, but there has not been any major progress on the ground since then.

The forces arrayed against ISIS are varied, according to retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters.

“This is a real mish-mosh,” said Peters, a Fox News contributor. “You have Shia militias -- not all of whom get along, by the way, Iraqi troops, police and some Sunni tribesmen. Iran is deeply involved in helping them plan and supervising the operation, but it is compartmentalized. It won’t be Sunni tribesmen and Shia militias standing shoulder-to-shoulder. So coordination is going to be a nightmare.”

Peters said retaking Fallujah, a much smaller city than Ramadi and closer to Baghdad, will be easier. Going into Ramadi, where ISIS has been dug in for two months and likely booby-trapped buildings, will be a dangerous and painstaking process, he said. And there is one more tactic to worry about, according to Peters.

“ISIS is very smart,” he said. “When they are attacked in one area, they strike in another area. It would not be surprising to see an asymmetric response -- perhaps a new attack on Tikrit or the oil fields in the north.”

Hadi al-Ameri, commander of the largest Shi'ite force, the Badr Organization, told Iraqi television Sunday he expected the main attack on Fallujah to happen after the Eid holiday which starts later this week.

Residents in Fallujah and Ramadi reported heavy bombardment of both cities early on Monday.

In a brief statement, Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, vowed to ""take revenge from Daesh criminals on the battlefield... and their cowardly crimes against unarmed civilians will only increase our determination to chase them and to expel them from the land of Iraq.""

The Islamic State group, also known by the Arabic acronym Daesh, seized large parts of Anbar in early 2014 and captured Ramadi in May. Iraqi forces, which had been making steady progress against the extremists in recent months with the help of the air campaign, scored a major victory in recapturing Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit last month.

During the past few weeks, the troops have been moving to cut the militants' supply routes and to surround and isolate Ramadi and Fallujah.

Rasool didn't provide any further details on the ongoing operations. By noon, the country's state TV reported government forces recapturing villages and areas around Fallujah.

Meanwhile Monday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Sunday's series of bombings in Shiite areas of the capital, Baghdad, that killed at least 29 people and wounded 81 others, according to the ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency.

Iraq is going through its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops. The Islamic State group controls large swaths of the country's north and west after capturing Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul and the majority of Anbar province.

6035.0,UKIP MEPs Steven Woolfe & Mike Hookem reported to French police over Strasbourg scuffle,"UKIP MEPs Steven Woolfe & Mike Hookem reported to French police over... UKIP MEPs Steven Woolfe & Mike Hookem reported to French police over Strasbourg scuffle By 0 61 
MEPs Steven Woolfe and Mike Hookem have been reported to French police over an altercation at the EU’s Strasbourg parliament, which saw Woolfe hospitalized and plunged crisis-hit UKIP into further turmoil. 
European Parliament President Martin Schulz said he had referred the “regrettable” incident to the French authorities “given the seriousness of the reported facts and their possible criminal implications.” 
Schulz says he had been recommended to do so by the European Parliament’s advisory committee on conduct, according to the Press Association. Following recommendation of EP Advisory Committee on Code of Conduct, I referred incident involving MEPs Hookem and Woolfe to FR authorities 
— EP President (@EP_President) October 26, 2016 Based on the result of the investigations, I will then take a decision about sanctions to be imposed according to EP rules 
— EP President (@EP_President) October 26, 2016 
“The committee concluded that the versions of the facts given by the two members involved diverged substantially and the facts seem to have happened in the absence of direct witnesses,” he told the parliament.

“It also stressed that given the seriousness of the reported facts and their possible criminal implications, further evidence is needed to clarify this matter. 
“As a result I have decided to follow the recommendation of the advisory committee and I have referred this matter to the competent French authorities. 
“Based on the result of the investigations, I will then take a decision about a sanction to be imposed.” Hookem off the hook 
An internal investigation by UKIP published on Wednesday afternoon ruled Hookem should not be held responsible for the altercation. 
“ In the absence of eye witnesses, the true facts of what took place in the ante room itself are impossible to determine and neither man has made an official complaint to the party over the incident. ” 
Despite the ruling, party investigators went into a detailed hypothesis as to what took place in the ante room between Hookem and Woolfe. The only thing it determines with any certainty is that “ the door was open prior to Mr Woofle’s fall. ” 
The investigation concludes Hookem was not close enough to the ante room door to open it himself, and so it is “ reasonable to assume that Mr Woolf opened the door whilst attempting to exit the ante room backwards. ” 
“ The investigation does find it unlikely that Hookem was in a position to be able to push Woolfe through the door, given where he was standing in the ante room immediately afterwards, but in the absence of an eye witness, it cannot make a definite determination .” 
While the report lets Hookem off the hook, it actually finds a series of quotes given by Woolfe to the Daily Mail earlier this month to have brought the party into “ disrepute .” 
“ Had Mr Woolfe continued his membership of the party, a disciplinary panel would have been convened to investigate these quotes ,” the report concludes. Crying Woolfe 
Woolfe quit UKIP last week, abandoning his leadership bid, and branded the party “ungovernable” without Nigel Farage as leader and the EU referendum to unite supporters. 
He will now sit as an independent in the European Parliament. 
Woolfe stands by the claim he “received a blow” from Hookem during an altercation at a private meeting of UKIP MEPs, where they were discussing Woolfe’s rumored plan to defect to the Conservatives. 
Woolfe says the incident caused him to suffer two seizures, partial paralysis and the loss of feeling in his face and body. He says he issued a police complaint. 
Hookem denies hitting Woolfe. 
The fallout from the incident has continued with claims Woolfe has been warned about “inappropriate behavior” by senior party figures. 
Hookem has also claimed Woolfe signed for £276 (US$300) in daily allowances at the European Parliament three times while recovering from his injuries earlier this month. 
Woolfe had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to replace Diane James, whose term as UKIP leader lasted just 18 days. 
Among the other contenders are Suzanne Evans, Paul Nuttall and Raheem Kassam. 
Also running is John Rees-Evans, who apologized this week over a 2014 claim that a “ homosexual donkey ” tried to rape his horse. He described the comments as “ playful banter .” 
The new UKIP leader will be announced on November 28.

two members involved diverged substantially and the facts seem to have happened in the absence of direct witnesses he told the parliament read more it also stressed that given the seriousness of the reported facts and their possible criminal implications further evidence is needed to clarify this matter as a result i have decided to follow the recommendation of the advisory committee and i have referred this matter to the competent french authorities based on the result of the investigations i will then take a decision about a sanction to be imposed hookem off the hook an internal investigation by ukip published on wednesday afternoon ruled hookem should not be held responsible for the altercation  in the absence of eye witnesses the true facts of what took place in the ante room itself are impossible to determine and neither man has made an official complaint to the party over the incident  despite the ruling party investigators went into a detailed hypothesis as to what took place in the ante room between hookem and woolfe the only thing it determines with any certainty is that  the door was open prior to mr woofles fall  the investigation concludes hookem was not close enough to the ante room door to open it himself and so it is  reasonable to assume that mr woolf opened the door whilst attempting to exit the ante room backwards   the investigation does find it unlikely that hookem was in a position to be able to push woolfe through the door given where he was standing in the ante room immediately afterwards but in the absence of an eye witness it cannot make a definite determination  while the report lets hookem off the hook it actually finds a series of quotes given by woolfe to the daily mail earlier this month to have brought the party into  disrepute   had mr woolfe continued his membership of the party a disciplinary panel would have been convened to investigate these quotes  the report concludes crying woolfe woolfe quit ukip last week abandoning his leadership bid and branded the party ungovernable without nigel farage as leader and the eu referendum to unite supporters he will now sit as an independent in the european parliament woolfe stands by the claim he received a blow from hookem during an altercation at a private meeting of ukip meps where they were discussing woolfes rumored plan to defect to the conservatives woolfe says the incident caused him to suffer two seizures partial paralysis and the loss of feeling in his face and body he says he issued a police complaint hookem denies hitting woolfe the fallout from the incident has continued with claims woolfe has been warned about inappropriate behavior by senior party figures hookem has also claimed woolfe signed for  us in daily allowances at the european parliament three times while recovering from his injuries earlier this month woolfe had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to replace diane james whose term as ukip leader lasted just  days among the other contenders are suzanne evans paul nuttall and raheem kassam also running is john reesevans who apologized this week over a  claim that a  homosexual donkey  tried to rape his horse he described the comments as  playful banter  the new ukip leader will be announced on november  via rt  this piece was reprinted by rinf alternative news with permission or license,"['ukip', 'meps',

2281.0,Justices Kennedy and Scalia and their divide on gay rights,"Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia were born in the same year, chosen by the same president, live on the same Northern Virginia street and, in serving together on the Supreme Court longer than any other current pair of justices, have many times voted the same conservative way.

But one issue — how the Constitution protects gay citizens — divides and defines the two like no other. This week’s historic hearing on same-sex marriage is both the logical extension and ultimate showdown in a decades-long argument that so far Kennedy has always won.

[Here’s what the fallout of a ruling could be in the various states]

Each of Kennedy’s bold and lyrical rulings on behalf of gays — “times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,” he wrote in Lawrence v. Texas — has been just as reliably followed by a meticulous and fiery denunciation from Scalia.

“The court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed,” Scalia answered in the Lawrence case.

Kennedy has written all of the Supreme Court’s most important decisions on gay rights: protecting the civil rights of homosexuals in Romer v. Evans (1996), abolishing anti-gay sodomy laws in Lawrence (2003) and ruling in United States v. Windsor two years ago that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages.

Each was a steppingstone to the Supreme Court’s consideration on Tuesday of whether the Constitution forbids states from prohibiting gay couples to marry.

If the pattern continues and the court renders a landmark ruling favoring gay marriage, it will likely once again be Kennedy whose words memorialize that decision and Scalia who will articulate the dissent.

It is not a conflict everyone would have predicted for two of Ronald Reagan’s choices for the court. Scalia ascended to the bench in 1986, and Kennedy followed 17 months later. The two, born on opposite coasts in 1936, are consistent comrades on issues important to corporate America and in dismantling campaign finance laws they see restricting political speech.

After Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sided with liberals to declare the Affordable Care Act constitutional, Scalia and Kennedy united with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. in a jointly written, 65-page dissent mocking the majority opinion and saying the entire act should be found invalid.

Kennedy is often the deciding vote when the ideologically divided court splits 5 to 4, but in two-thirds of those cases he sides with the conservatives.

But if they often arrive at the same conclusion — one obstacle for same-sex marriage proponents in the current case is Kennedy’s allegiance to states’ rights — Kennedy and Scalia could not be more different in how they view a judge’s role.

“Their different approach to gay rights reflects their more fundamental disagreement about how to think about the liberties protected by the Constitution,” said Paul M. Smith, a Washington lawyer who was on the winning side in the Lawrence case.

Scalia believes the only freedoms that should be viewed as protected by the Constitution “are those that have been protected under American law throughout our history, defined at the most specific level,” Smith said. Otherwise, the people decide.

Kennedy, Smith said, “believes that each generation has the right to conceive of newer and broader forms of liberty that merit constitutional protection. He sees history as a guide but not a straitjacket.”

Their battle is compelling, said Allison Orr Larsen, a William and Mary law professor, because it “brings to the forefront the theoretical question in constitutional law: How should courts respond to change when interpreting the Constitution?”

Michael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School and a former Kennedy clerk, said his former boss’s decisions on gay rights were not constructed to lead ultimately to a decision on same-sex marriage. But they provided a foundation for how to view new constitutional rights “if that’s where the country moves.”

Scalia, on the other hand, champions the cause of originalism, and Edward Whelan, a former Scalia clerk and president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said his former boss learned quickly that “Kennedy’s judicial approach was not anything close to what Scalia’s is.”

“A basic tenet of originalism is that it’s not the role of judges to impose their own moral philosophies,” Whelan said. “Scalia understands the Constitution to leave the vast bulk of policy issues to the democratic processes and rejects the notion that it’s his role to read his own views into the Constitution.”

It’s worth remembering the differences among President Reagan’s choices for the Supreme Court.

He fulfilled his campaign pledge to name a woman to the bench with Sandra Day O’Connor, the pragmatic Arizona politician and judge who quickly became the court’s center.

Scalia’s selection was celebrated by conservatives eager to see a new method of constitutional interpretation forcefully advocated on the court.

Kennedy was a compromise, Reagan’s third choice for the seat he once hoped would be filled by conservative Robert Bork, whose nomination was defeated in the Senate. “This was the Bork seat,” said Smith. “Things could have been much different.”

Kennedy’s views, Dorf said, were those of a “moderate California Republican.”

Although he never ruled for gay rights as a lower court judge, Kennedy expressed concern about the policy even as he upheld the military’s right to dismiss gay servicemen. And Frank J. Colucci, a political science professor at Purdue University who has written a book about Kennedy’s jurisprudence, recalled that Kennedy in a speech criticized the Supreme Court’s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick that upheld a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy.

“He came about as close as you can as a lower court judge to saying it was wrongly decided,” Colucci said.

Once on the court, Kennedy was able to say just that.

In the first gay rights case, Romer, Kennedy wrote for the majority in striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment. After some cities in the state began passing laws protecting gays from discrimination in housing, employment and other areas, voters through a referendum approved the amendment precluding such government protections.

Colorado’s amendment, Kennedy wrote, “classifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.”

That began something of a call-and-response on the issue: Kennedy delivering the majority’s opinion, Scalia replying with a scalding dissent, read from the bench for emphasis.

“This court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members of this institution are selected, pronouncing that ‘animosity’ toward homosexuality is evil,” Scalia wrote in Romer. “I vigorously dissent.”

In Lawrence, Kennedy got the chance to reverse the court’s decision on sodomy, and did: “Bowers was not correct when it was decided and it is not correct today.” Private, homosexual conduct between consenting adults, he wrote, “involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.”

O’Connor wrote a concurring opinion to say the ruling did not touch on the matter of whether gays would be able to marry.

Scalia wrote that homosexuals should be free to promote their cause through democratic means, but “many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children’s schools, or as boarders in their home.”

“They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive,” he wrote. “The court views it as ‘discrimination.’ ”

Two years ago, in Windsor, Kennedy wrote that the federal government’s refusal to offer the same government benefits available to heterosexual couples to legally married gay couples tells “all the world that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy” and “humiliates” their children.

Again, Scalia blasted the decision, saying the majority was merely being coy in saying the decision did not address whether states are required to give licenses for same-sex marriage.

“By formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,” he wrote.

Most federal courts have taken Scalia literally.

“The court agrees with Justice Scalia’s interpretation of Windsor,” wrote U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby of Salt Lake City.

Shelby’s decision to strike a marriage ban in Utah was the first such ruling following Windsor and began the path that continues to Tuesday’s oral arguments, and will end with the court’s decision in June.

40 years later: “I’ve got the license and the faggot letter”

9134.0,Justice Clarence Thomas Describes Washington DC As “Broken”,"WATCH: CNN Hack Humiliates Self, Tells Viewers U.S. Reps Are Term-Limited Already (They’re Not) 
That breakdown in communication in Washington is exactly what has fueled the rise of Trump . People are sick and tired of nothing getting done, at least nothing good, so they want a new leader who can actually accomplish great things. 
“I think that we have decided that rather than confront the disagreement and differences of opinion, we’ll just simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us,” Thomas said. 
Unfortunately he is exactly right. Both Republicans and Democrats are guilty of preferring to demonize their opponents rather than engaging in meaningful discussion.   
This sort of polarization doesn’t help America. All it does is increase the frustration the American people have with Congress when they see nothing happening for years. 
Trump has a history of making compromises and hammering out complex deals in the business world. Unlike Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump has a history of making things work. 
If Trump can bring about some real change in Washington, he can finally turn this country around.

1938.0,Jeb Bush's Foreign Policy Plan: More Military Spending Will 'Encourage Peace',"WASHINGTON -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will lay out a vision of American foreign policy on Wednesday aimed at pushing his nascent 2016 presidential campaign out of the shadow of his father and brother, two former presidents who waged overseas wars.

""I love my father and my brother … But I am my own man –- and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences,"" Bush will say in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to excerpts provided to reporters late Tuesday night.

In his first major foreign policy address, the likely 2016 Republican front-runner will make the case for increased military spending so America can ""project power and enforce peaceful stability in far-off areas of the globe."" He will also criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy, calling it ""inconsistent and indecisive.""

""Having a military that is equal to any threat ... makes it less likely that we will need to put our men and women in uniform in harm’s way,"" Bush plans to tell attendees, adding that he believes ""fundamentally, that weakness invites war… and strength encourages peace.""

The idea that a bigger U.S. military would act as a bigger deterrent to potential foes is one that reached its apex during the Cold War, but has been repeatedly challenged in the 21st century by the rise of global terrorism and sectarian conflicts.

The Obama administration is currently working to devise responses to a number of unconventional threats to global security. Chief among them are the rise of the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East, and the Russian-backed separatists waging guerrilla war in Ukraine.

From his speech, it appears that Bush would have America play a greater role than it already does in these conflicts. ""America does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world –- our security, our prosperity and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in often distant places,"" Bush will say. ""We have no reason to apologize for our leadership and our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace and human freedom.""

This vision of America's role in the world directly contradicts the view held by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another 2016 potential candidate, that the U.S. should avoid involvement in foreign conflicts unless they pose a direct threat to American lives.

But even as Bush stressed that he would devise his own way forward, plenty of his foreign policies invite comparisons, not contradictions, with those of his neoconservative brother, George W.Bush, and his realist father, George H.W. Bush. 

 One reason for this could be that Jeb Bush has consulted many of the same advisers his father and brother relied on to help them craft foreign policy while each was in office. The advisers represent a spectrum of conservative viewpoints, from the pragmatic James Baker, former secretary of state in the George H.W. Bush administration, to the fiercely ideological Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense in the George W. Bush administration.

Wolfowitz and Jeb Bush have held similar foreign policy ideas since at least 1997, when they were both signatories to a set of principles devised by the conservative Project for the New American Century, which were described by the group as a ""Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity."" Other signatories include former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.",REAL,washington  former florida gov jeb bush will lay out a vision of american foreign policy

1255.0,"John Kasich: He’s Conservative, but at Least He’s Sane","I worked for Kasich on Capitol Hill. Yes, he’s very conservative. But there are a few surprises in there, and he’s in Bizarro World.

With his surprising second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has vaulted out of the pack of also-rans to become the latest hope of two distinct groups of people: Republican operatives fearing what Donald Trump’s berserker candidacy might do to their party, and ordinary citizens simply hoping to have a sane presidential candidate to vote for.

Until this past week, Kasich has not attracted much attention, mainly because the current dynamic of media coverage encourages histrionics and preening. But by appearing halfway normal, as he did at last Saturday’s debate in South Carolina, and not engaging in theatrics about carpetbombing, waterboarding, or ripping up treaties, he has become the default choice of those who would worry if Kasich’s opponents ever got their hands on the nuclear switch.

He has the advantage (and disadvantage) of a long record. I had a chance to see him in action as I worked for him for 17 years on budget and armed services issues—although I’ve had no connection to him in over a decade, or to his campaign, and am now a political independent.

In the 1980s, at the dawn of his congressional career, many members of his own party considered Kasich a conservative bomb thrower—he would offer his own budget, something back-benchers weren’t supposed to do in those days. He has not changed ideologically or temperamentally—his 2011 effort to roll back labor protection for state employees was too extreme and Ohio voters overwhelmingly defeated it—but while Kasich has remained a staunch conservative, much of his party has lurched so far right it has entered Bizarro World.

This fact accounts for Kasich’s reputation as a RINO (Republican in name only) and why it may be more difficult for him to win his own party’s nomination than the general election. His apostasy in having Ohio accept Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is unforgivable to Republicans who consider health insurance for the poor to be an instrument of Satan. Likewise, in 1994 he voted for an assault weapons ban, pure heresy for the burgeoning Ted Nugent wing of his party. Kasich’s practice of occasionally dissing wealthy GOP donors who are accustomed to blind deference is considered a minus among the party’s bigwigs.

Those deeds might help, though, in a general election. So might his national security experience: 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee counts for far more involvement in that field than all his opponents combined. Refreshingly, as a congressman he avoided the kneejerk military interventionism that is now mandatory for GOP candidates. He opposed authorizing the Marines’ mission in Lebanon in 1983; the bombing of the Marine barracks in October of that year and President Reagan’s decision to quickly withdraw vindicated Kasich’s stand.

Similarly, he opposed President Clinton’s bombing of Serbia, which in his view amounted to a drive-by shooting with cruise missiles in a conflict in which no discernible U.S. interests were involved. He was also able to work across the aisle with Democrats to put a stake through the heart of the B-2 bomber, a Cold War anachronism, which at $2.2 billion a copy had become an unaffordable luxury.

As Budget Committee chairman, Kasich was also present at the creation of the first balanced budget since the Eisenhower era. While other factors, such as an avalanche of revenues from the dot.com bubble, set the stage for the achievement, he had a formidable job just to keep his own colleagues on task. The defense hawks were always itching to bust the budget caps with more Pentagon spending. And then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, who appeared to suffer from ADD, occasionally threatened to derail the difficult march to a balanced budget with novel and unvetted policy visions.

The general election downside? Just as there are legitimate questions about Hillary Clinton’s receiving $675,000 from Goldman Sachs for three speeches, Kasich as a nominee would surely face scrutiny over his eight years as a managing director at Lehman Brothers. The investment bank’s collapse in September 2008, the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, nearly pitched the global economy into the abyss. Lawsuits to settle the dismantling of Lehman are still reverberating through the financial world. Ohio voters gave him a pass, but national inspection of his record would be more thorough—certainly if Clinton’s campaign had anything to do with it.

Stories occasionally surface about Kasich’s anger management problem. As a former employee, I can corroborate those allegations, as well as his tendency to preachy self-righteousness that is a constant temptation of professional politicians. These are, perhaps, pardonable sins both in view of the tasteless vaudeville act being played out by several of his GOP competitors, and his own positive accomplishments.",REAL,i worked for kasich on

4618.0,2006 Audio Emerges of Hillary Clinton Proposing Rigging Palestine Election,"On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.

The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.

The tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton’s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is “rigged.”

Speaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).

“I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,” said Sen. Clinton. “And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.”

Chomsky recalls being taken aback that “anyone could support the idea—offered by a national political leader, no less—that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.”

Some eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.

Regarding capturing combatants in war—the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind—Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, “And then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there’s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we’ve got to capture a soldier.”

Equating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Department’s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper’s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase “these cultures” is also a bit of a head-scratcher.

According to Chomsky, Clinton was “gracious, personable and pleasant throughout” the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.

Another part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign—speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he’d “get along” with Putin.

Chomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.

“Do you think it’s worth talking to Syria—both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel’s point [of view]?”

Clinton replied, “You know, I’m pretty much of the mind that I don’t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you’re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,” an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.

Shortly after, she said, “But if you say, ‘they’re evil, we’re good, [and] we’re never dealing with them,’ I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them…So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I’ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That’s my take on it.”

A final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, “I think you can make the case that whether you call it ‘Islamic terrorism’ or ‘Islamo-fascism,’ whatever the label is we’re going to give to this phenomenon, it’s a threat. It’s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States…Therefore we need a global response. It’s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle…So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there’s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.”

It’s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what’s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase “Islamic terrorism” and the even more strident “Islamo-fascism,” at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.

In an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some “odd and controversial comments” on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined “Hillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,” is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic site offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.

“I went to my bosses at the time,” Chomsky told the Observer. “The Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody—even a direct quote from anyone—in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn’t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.”

3602.0,Authorities search for clues after raid thwarts potential 'Belgian Charlie Hebdo' attack,"Belgian authorities were searching for clues early Friday after police killed two in raids aimed at jihadists returning from Syria who were planning to launch a ""Belgian Charlie Hebdo"" attack, officials said.

Police were searching in Verviers, where the raid took place, and the greater Brussels area as part of a weeklong investigation that started well before the terrorism spree last week that led to 17 deaths in the Paris area. The Belgian operations had no apparent link to the terrorist acts committed in France.

And, unlike the Paris terrorists, who attacked the office of a satirical newspaper and a kosher grocery store, the suspects in Belgium were reportedly aiming at hard targets: police installations.

""They were on the verge of committing important terror attacks,"" federal magistrate Eric Van der Sypt said at a news conference in Brussels.

Across Europe, anxiety has grown as the manhunt continues for potential accomplices of the three Paris terrorists, all of whom were shot dead by French police. Authorities in Belgium signaled they were ready for more trouble by raising the national terror alert level from 2 to 3, the second-highest level.

Prime Minister Charles Michel said the increase in the threat level was ""a choice for prudence.""

""There is no concrete or specific knowledge of new elements of threat,"" he said.

The suspects in Verviers opened fire on police when they closed in on them near the city's train station, the magistrate told reporters. There was an intense firefight for several minutes. Video posted online showed a dark view of a building amid blasts, gunshots and sirens, and a fire with smoke billowing up. Two terror suspects were killed in the shootout, and another was arrested.

No police were wounded or killed in the clash, which occurred at the height of rush hour in a crowded neighborhood of this former industrial town of 56,000 about 80 miles southeast of the capital, Brussels.

Belgian news site L'Avenir, as well as Le Soir and France24, reported late Thursday that the government prosecutor's office said a dozen operations were launched against suspects across Belgium, in Verviers, Brussels and Hal-Vilvoorde. Some of those targeted are known to have returned recently from Syria.

The Belgian news site reported that, based on phone intercepts in the homes and cars of the three individuals involved in a shootout in Verviers, authorities believed the three were in the process of carrying out imminent attacks inside Belgium.

The French daily Le Soir is reporting that the investigations were launched against the Verviers suspects at least two weeks ago after they returned from Syria where they were thought to be involved in the fighting there.

The raids earlier Thursday included one on an apartment above a bakery in the eastern city of Verviers, authorities said. Authorities said the terror cell had ties to ISIS and was planning a major attack.

Earlier Thursday, Belgian authorities said they were looking into possible links between a man they arrested in the southern city of Charleroi for illegal trade in weapons and Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four people in a Paris kosher market last week.

The man arrested in Belgium ""claims that he wanted to buy a car from the wife of Coulibaly,"" Van der Sypt said. ""At this moment this is the only link between what happened in Paris.""

Van der Sypt said that ""of course, naturally"" we are continuing the investigation.

At first, the man came to police himself claiming there had been contact with Coulibaly's common-law wife regarding the car, but he was arrested following a search of his premises when indications of illegal weapons trading were found.

A Belgian connection figured in a 2010 French criminal investigation into a foiled terrorist plot in which Coulibaly was one of the convicted co-conspirators. The plotters included a Brussels-area contact who was supposed to furnish both weapons and ammunition, according to French judicial documents obtained by The Associated Press.

Several other countries are also involved in the hunt for possible accomplices to Coulibaly and the other gunmen in the French attacks, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi.

In Spain, authorities said Coulibaly drove his common-law wife from France to Madrid on Dec. 31 and was with her until she took a Jan. 2 flight to Istanbul.

Spain's National Court said in a statement it was investigating what Coulibaly did in the country's capital with his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, and a third person who wasn't identified but is suspected of helping Boumeddiene get from Turkey to Syria.

France is on edge since last week's attacks, which began at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The paper, repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, buried several of its slain staff members Thursday even as it reprinted another weekly issue with Muhammad on its cover.

Also, defense officials said France was under an unprecedented cyber assault with 19,000 cyberattacks launched after the country's bloodiest terrorist attacks in decades, frustrating authorities as they try to thwart repeat violence.

Around 120,000 security forces are deployed to prevent future attacks.

Calling it an unprecedented surge, Adm. Arnaud Coustilliere, head of cyberdefense for the French military, said about 19,000 French websites had faced cyberattacks in recent days, some carried out by well-known Islamic hacker groups.

The attacks, mostly relatively minor denial-of-service attacks, hit sites as varied as military regiments to pizza shops but none appeared to have caused serious damage, he said. Military authorities launched round-the-clock surveillance to protect the government sites still coming under attack.

The Kouachi brothers claimed allegiance to Al Qaeda in Yemen, and Coulibaly to the Islamic State group.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.",REAL,belgian authorities were searching for clues early friday after police killed two in raids aimed at jihadists returning from syria who were planning to launch a belgian charlie hebdo attack officials said police were searching in verviers where the raid took place and the greater brussels area as part of a weeklong investigation that started well before the terrorism spree last week that led to  deaths in the paris area the belgian operations had no apparent link to the terrorist acts committed in france and unlike the paris terrorists who attacked the office of a satirical newspaper and a kosher grocery store the suspects in belgium were reportedly aiming at hard targets police installations they were on the verge of committing important terror attacks federal magistrate eric van der sypt said at a news conference in brussels across europe anxiety has grown as the manhunt continues for potential accomplices of the three paris terrorists all of whom were shot dead by french police authorities in belgium signaled they were ready for more trouble by raising the national terror alert level from  to  the secondhighest level prime minister charles michel said the increase in the threat level was a choice for prudence there is no concrete or specific knowledge of new elements of threat he said the

shootout in verviers authorities believed the three were in the process of carrying out imminent attacks inside belgium the french daily le soir is reporting that the investigations were launched against the verviers suspects at least two weeks ago after they returned from syria where they were thought to be involved in the fighting there the raids earlier thursday included one on an apartment above a bakery in the eastern city of verviers authorities said authorities said the terror cell had ties to isis and was planning a major attack earlier thursday belgian authorities said they were looking into possible links between a man they arrested in the southern city of charleroi for illegal trade in weapons and amedy coulibaly who killed four people in a paris kosher market last week the man arrested in belgium claims that he wanted to buy a car from the wife of coulibaly van der sypt said at this moment this is the only link between what happened in paris van der sypt said that of course naturally we are continuing the investigation at first the man came to police himself claiming there had been contact with coulibalys commonlaw wife regarding the car but he was arrested

coulibaly was one of the convicted coconspirators the plotters included a brusselsarea contact who was supposed to furnish both weapons and ammunition according to french judicial documents obtained by the associated press several other countries are also involved in the hunt for possible accomplices to coulibaly and the other gunmen in the french attacks brothers cherif and said kouachi in spain

5918.0,Trump’s Gettysburg Address against the New World Order,"Tweet Home » Headlines » Finance News » Trump’s Gettysburg Address against the New World Order 
The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 

Submitted by James Hall : 
If not now, WHEN? Only the most dedicated Totalitarian Collectivist would want to keep the NWO in power. Those who are so dim-witted to believe that the governance elites are legitimate rulers, exercising moral authority are so ignorant and illiterate that they deserve the fate of sheep taken to the slaughter. The Sheeple designation is apt for a society mired in a distorted reality of serfdom. 
The New World Order moved from a century’s old scheme to enslave humanity into a consolidated “ international community ”, when the central banksters organized the Bank for International Settlements, with the adoption of the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, the reorganization of nation states with the end of World War II, the creation of the globalist United Nations and the establishment of the centralized bureaucracy of the European Union. 
The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 
It is because of this opposition to the transnational ruling despots that the vicious, deceitful and unending assault on Trump and his followers has been unleashed, since real meaningful change cannot be allowed that would reverse the systematic destruction of Western Civilization.

DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER 
What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter – and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. 
On the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: 
 FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 
 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
 THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator 
 FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately 
 FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. 
 SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward 
 SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure 
Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: 
 FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama 
 SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States 
 THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities 
 FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back 
 FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. 
Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. 
This is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. 
Publishing the entire list of all these positive measures, which challenge the elitist consortium of a criminal syndicate that impose a neo-feudal enslavement of humanity, documents the essence of the Trump vow of revolutionary nonviolent combat against the forces of satanic evil. 
The ironic symbolism of presenting this restoration of national greatness at the site of the historic betrayal of the original American Revolution, one must not forget that Abraham Lincoln embarked upon the initial destruction of the legitimate States’ Right essence that created the country. 
This apocalyptic step, set into motion the underpinnings of a global empire of which, America was never intended to pursue. Let’s hope that Donald Trump can rectify some of the damage done to the individual rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence. Gettysburg was not a victory for a union of free men, but was the launching of a lustful hegemony for an Imperium international order.

4492.0,'Spinning up as we speak': Email shows Pentagon was ready to roll as Benghazi attack occurred,"As the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was unfolding, a high-ranking Pentagon official urgently messaged Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s top deputies to offer military help, according to an email obtained by Judicial Watch.

The revelation appears to contradict testimony Defense Secretary Leon Panetta gave lawmakers in 2013, when he said there was no time to get forces to the scene in Libya, where four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens.

“I just tried you on the phone but you were all in with S [apparent reference to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton],” reads the email, from Panetta’s chief of staff Jeremy Bash. “After consulting with General Dempsey, General Ham and the Joint Staff, we have identified the forces that could move to Benghazi. They are spinning up as we speak.”

The email was sent out at 7:19 p.m. ET on Sept. 11, 2012, in the early stages of the eight-hour siege that also claimed the lives of Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, private CIA contractors who raced to the aid of embattled State Department workers.

Although the email came after the first wave of the attack at the consulate, it occurred before a mortar strike on the CIA annex killed Woods and Doherty.

“This leaves no doubt military assets were offered and ready to go, and awaiting State Department signoff, which did not come,” Judicial Watch, a nonprofit government watchdog said in a statement.

Parts of the email from Bash were redacted before release, including details on what military forces were available.

In defending the Obama administration’s lack of a military response to the attack, Panetta told the Senate Armed Services Committee nearly two years ago that “time, distance, the lack of an adequate warning, events that moved very quickly on the ground prevented a more immediate response.”

The first assault occurred at the consulate at 3:40 p.m. ET. The second attack on the CIA annex a little over a mile away began three hours later. Bash’s email was sent approximately 40 minutes after that attack began.

Bash’s email, which bore the subject line “Libya,” was sent to Clinton’s then-deputy chief of staff Jacob Sullivan, Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Thomas Nides.

The attack came in three waves at two locations. It began when a handful of attackers scaled the wall of the diplomatic post at dusk and opened a gate, allowing dozens of armed men inside who then set the building on fire. Stevens and Smith died after breathing in smoke while hiding in a safe room, and later died.

Hours later, a nearby CIA annex was attacked twice. Woods and Doherty died there while defending the annex from the rooftop. A team of six security officials summoned from Tripoli and a Libyan military unit helped evacuate the remaining U.S. personnel who were taken to an airport and flown out of Benghazi.

The Obama administration later falsely claimed that the attack was triggered by an Internet video that insulted Islam.

Lawmakers investigating the events surrounding Benghazi already had acquired the e-mail, along with tens of thousands of others related to the probe, according to Matt Wolking, spokesman for the House Select Committee on Benghazi.

“The Select Committee has obtained and reviewed tens of thousands of documents in the course of its thorough, fact-centered investigation into the Benghazi terrorist attacks, and this information will be detailed in the final report the Committee hopes to release within the next few months,"" Wolking told FoxNews.com. ""While the Committee does not rush to release or comment on every document it uncovers, I can confirm that we obtained the unredacted version of this email last year, in addition to Jake Sullivan’s response.""",REAL,as the attack on the us consulate in benghazi was unfolding a highranking pentagon official urgently messaged secretary of state hillary clintons top deputies to offer military help

2432.0,A Case Study On Why The Obamacare Lawsuit Is Based On Mythical History,"The Bentley administration, the Alabama legislature and the governor’s Alabama Health Insurance Exchange Study Commission weighed many of the same issues their counterparts in other states did. How would they finance the exchange's operations? Should a state agency or some other entity manage a new marketplace? How heavily should insurance companies be regulated? Would it better for Alabama to exert at least a little control over Obamacare, or to just let the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services do the work?

If that was the case four years ago, no one told Alabama state Sen. Jim McClendon (R), a native English speaker who co-chaired Bentley’s commission while a member of the state House of Representatives, which unanimously passed a bill in April 2012 to establish an Alabama health insurance exchange.

 

 “No. No. No. That was never, never brought up,” McClendon said in an interview with The Huffington Post last month. “I was unaware of that stipulation in the Affordable Care Act, and I would almost have to guess that anybody involved in this process was not aware of it. I was a little surprised when it came up eventually. Nope. I was the chairman of the commission and I was totally unaware of that.”

“Never. It was never discussed,” said Carey, who also worked with Delaware and Tennessee on their exchanges at the time, when he was a subcontractor working for LMI, a Tysons, Virginia-based government contractor. “It was never a consideration that they weren’t going to get subsidies if they deferred to the feds. I mean, I was there at every commission meeting and I was presenting, ‘Here are your options, here’s what I think it might cost you,’ and we did those type of calculations.""

I don’t remember that coming up. I really don’t. I really don’t ever remember that ever being brought up as an issue... I don’t ever remember anybody saying, ‘Well, if we do this and let the feds do it, this is the trade-off down the road'... I’m almost positive somebody would’ve brought it up... During the time, we didn’t know that. After the commission, that’s when all that stuff started coming out. We were like, ‘Oh, wait a minute.’ That could’ve really changed, obviously, the advice to the governor, because I don’t think he would’ve even said we’re not going to do it if it was clear at that point in time, all the way back four, five years ago, that if you don’t do this, here’s the side effect. Because that’s a huge trade-off.

Wren was the author of the health insurance exchange bill the state House passed in April 2012, and he championed a state-run marketplace until Bentley’s final decision in December of that year to forgo a state exchange. Wren told HuffPost he still believes Alabama should have its own exchange.

 

 Wren claimed in an interview that he was aware, early on, of a provision in the law that would restrict subsidies to those who purchased coverage on state exchanges. But in a subsequent email, his account shifted. Wren first said that issue came to his attention in 2009, before Obamacare had even passed. In a subsequent email, he wrote that he had misspoken during the interview, and said he'd actually learned of this phrase in 2011.

 

 “I believed at the time that for many reasons, including the possible favorable premium treatment to individuals purchasing from a state exchange, that Alabama should consider this over a federal,” he wrote.



 Greg Wren, then a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, in 2011.

 

 There is little evidence to back Wren's claim that he was aware of the now-controversial provision in Obamacare during his state’s debate over whether to establish an exchange. The former legislator could not offer an explanation for why his version of events differs from those of McClendon and the others interviewed for this article, or why it isn’t reflected in official documents or media accounts from the time.

 

 “At this point I can only say is [sic] I remembered back as best I could,” he wrote in an email.

Wren also acknowledged that he has no documentation from 2010 through 2012 to support his assertions that he understood the phrase “established by the state” could mean that subsidies wouldn’t be available in federal exchanges. The Alabama legislature does not transcribe floor or committee proceedings, so no official record exists of the debate on Wren’s bill.

5307.0,Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I’ve Insulted Deserved It,"Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I’ve Insulted Deserved It By Andrew Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe 
Arrogance is defined as “an insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.” In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. 
Appearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he’s made on Twitter: “It’s ok, most of them deserved it.” 
Trump then declared : “I believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I’ll use that. And I agree sometimes it will revert back or sometimes maybe it doesn’t come out — you have to be careful with it.” 
When exactly has Trump been careful with what he posts on social media? Try never. 
Melania Trump, who was also interviewed, said that if she becomes First Lady, one of her primary areas of focus would be social media: “What’s going on is very hurtful to children, to some adults as well.” 
Does that mean she’ll take away Donald’s cell phone and duct tape his hands to his sides so he can’t tweet out hateful and hurtful shit the way he normally does? Yeah, good luck with that, Melania! 
Earlier this week, the New York Times ran a two-page spread listing all of the insults and unkind postings Trump has made on Twitter since he announced he would be running for President in 2015. If you want to see a completely unhinged, uninformed, and unfiltered mind at work, just take a look at the Times article and recall what Hillary Clinton said regarding the Donald: “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” 
Donald Trump cannot be trusted with a smart phone, let alone the reins of power for the most important nation in the world.

(CNN) The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is “rigged,” claiming that Trump’s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities. 
The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.

9948.0,US Airstrikes on Iraqi Army Slowing Advance on Mosul,"By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on October 29, 2016 Several Iraqi Soldiers killed by US Airstrike Near Mosul With a blocking force in place preventing ISIS from moving into Syria, reported by Iranian press, the US is doing everything possible to slow down the Iraqi Army and prevent successful operations. There have long been suspicions that the Kurds, who let thousands of ISIS oil trucks through their region each week, have been working with ISIS all along. It was the Kurds, not the real Kurds, but Barzani’s Saudi run dictatorship in Erbil, that invited Turkey into Iraq. Deputy Chief of the Nineveh Provincial Council Noureddin Qablan announced that the US-led coalition warplanes have launched airstrikes on army base in Nineveh province, killing several soldiers. “The US fighter jets hit one of the military bases of Iraqi Army’s 16th Division in a region North of Mosul, and the attack left at least four Iraqi soldiers dead,” Qablan said. According to FNA, He said that the US army has confirmed the attack, calling it a “mistake”. Qablan said that it is not the first time the US warplanes hit the Iraqi army and volunteer forces (Hashd al-Shaabi) military positions, adding, “The US-led coalition has each time said that air raids were not deliberate.” It is reported that another peshmerga convoy accidentally hit by an USA-led coalition airstrike near Mosul today. That’s was 3 “Mistakan Raid” in 24 hours.

4713.0,Donald Trump's GOP civil war,"Panama City, Florida (CNN) Donald Trump is tearing the Grand Old Party apart.

The tension that has simmered in the Republican Party for years -- shutting down the government and nearly bringing the nation to default -- escalated into an outright civil war Tuesday. The conflict not only threatens the party's ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month, but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump loses.

On one side is Trump, who spent much of Tuesday lashing out on social media at his GOP foes, such as Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, and lamenting the lack of party unity. He's backed by conservative lawmakers including Iowa Rep. Steve King and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies, including the one here in Panama City, Florida, Tuesday, where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent, Hillary Clinton.

Some are even raising the potential of denying Ryan the speakership after the election.

On the other side is Ryan, who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority. That dominance of Capitol Hill is suddenly threatened -- and not just in the Senate, where there are many competitive races, but also in the House, where the GOP majority was considered untouchable until recently.

The infighting -- sparked by the release Friday of a 2005 video depicting Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms -- isn't likely to ease in the 27 days before Election Day. Trump made clear Tuesday that if he loses in November, he won't go down quietly -- or alone.

He began the day with a series of shots -- taken over Twitter -- at Ryan, saying it's hard to do well when the speaker isn't supportive. He followed up about an hour later calling Ryan a ""weak and ineffective leader.""

And nearly two hours after that, Trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day.

'Shackles have been taken off me'

Trump continued his attacks on Ryan Wednesday during a rally in central Florida, where he said he's at a disadvantage when ""you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people.""

He also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his Sunday night debate performance.

""Wouldn't you think Paul Ryan would call and say good job?"" he said. ""It got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. You'd think they'd say great going, Don, let's beat this crook. No, he doesn't.""

Trump's turn on his own party may seem counterproductive -- it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching Clinton. But it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year.

And by blaming Republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign, Trump also opens up the possibility of a face-saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in November.

But the cost to the Republican Party of Trump's burn-it-down-around-him strategy is already high, could become more extreme and potentially leave the GOP badly damaged long after he has left the political scene.

To begin with, the estrangement between Trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the party's grass roots and its establishment leaders that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer.

It is a divide that will be hard to overcome if Trump loses the election. Forging unity could be impossible if hordes of Trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other Republican has managed in decades.

King, the Iowa Republican congressman, warned Tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary, saying ""the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that's going on right now.""

""They've gone so far out on this limb,"" King said on the Laura Ingraham radio show.

The meltdown in the GOP is the culmination of forces that have been building for years. Intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose President Barack Obama gave rise to the Tea Party and sent waves of anti-establishment lawmakers to Washington in successive elections.

Trump's adoption of a factually-challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the GOP presidential ticket through the role of Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, who serves as the CEO of the Trump campaign.

Trump's turn against his own party could also reverberate in down-ballot races. Republicans have long known that their hold on the Senate was tenuous -- whoever ran at the top of their ticket -- but Trump's slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too.

At the very least, a Trump implosion that cuts deeply into Ryan's majority could complicate the Speaker's already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition. If an anti-Trump landslide sweeps away House GOP members in more moderate districts, it could hand more relative power to the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on John Boehner, his predecessor.

The dilemma is especially difficult for Republican senators running for re-election. Some are rejecting Trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters. But at the same time, they risk alienating Trump supporters in states's where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race.

New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing Trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider GOP conundrum. Ayotte finally said she could not vote for Trump after the video emerged on Friday.

But another star of the GOP, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Tuesday he's not yet ready to back away from Trump. Rubio looks certain to need Trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re-election race. But at the same time, if more explosive video emerges about Trump, Rubio, who has presidential ambitions in his future, risks being tarnished by association with the Republican nominee.

Another lawmaker in a tough re-election race who is hedging his bets is North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who said that while Trump's comments were ""indefensible,"" he still plans to support him.

For her part, the turmoil consuming the GOP would seem to provide a substantial boost to Clinton's White House bid. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found the Democratic nominee enjoying a 9-point lead among likely voters in a four-way race.

But her aides caution against excessive optimism. There's concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race -- which could only become darker in the days ahead -- could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls. In that instance, a lower turnout could create an advantage for Trump.

""This seems to be their strategy, disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won't come out to the polls,"" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, told reporters Tuesday. ""I think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate.""

Clinton said as much herself during an interview with a Florida radio station Tuesday.

""Despite all of the terrible things (Trump) has said and done, he is still trying to win this election,"" she said. ""And we cannot be complacent, we cannot rest.""",REAL,panama city florida cnn donald trump is tearing the grand old party apart the tension that has simmered in the republican party for years

“Primary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in Free Syria in order to spread chaos.” The statement also added: “The Syrian interim government’s health ministry has instructed a halt to the second round of the measles vaccination campaign, which began Monday September 15th … following several fatalities and injuries among children in vaccination centers in the Idlib countryside.” Adnan Hazouri, the health minister in the Syrian opposition who held a conference (in the Arabic Language) said that he will resign if an investigation upheld allegations of negligence, as blood samples have been sent to Turkey for analysis. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , which is based in London, also confirmed: 
“At least five children have died and 50 others are suffering from poisoning or allergic reactions after measles vaccinations in Jirjanaz, in the Idlib province.” The following video shows affected children in Saraqeb hospital in Idlib, Syria: Monther Khalil, the head of the Idlib medical department said this during an interview with Radio Hawa Smart -an opposition related station established on Gaziantep, Turkey: 
“The department assures all parents who have had their children vaccinated that the vaccine is completely fine and there is no risk to children who have already been injected. 
We have already vaccinated 60,000 children against measles and there has been no previous problem.

Many in the packed auditorium took her words as a coded criticism of Mr Trump, whose foreign policy plans have been condemned as isolationist and weak on detail.

His closest rival Ted Cruz has also made clear that the US has no role in Afghanistan other than fighting terrorism.

In contrast, Mrs Clinton was among those who offered a cover endorsement for Mrs Bush's Afghan book. “For over a decade, Laura Bush has been an ally and advocate for the women of Afghanistan and, in particular, has worked to ensure that the voices of Afghan women are heard,” she wrote.

8428.0,Why Hillary Won't Unleash WWIII    : Information," Why Hillary Won't Unleash WWIII By Pepe Escobar October 31, 2016 "" Information Clearing House "" - "" RT "" - She is fully supported by virtually the whole US establishment; a bipartisan, neocon/neoliberalcon, regime change/humanitarian imperialist axis.
On the opposite side, for all his personal pathology problems and incoherent twitter-mouth ramblings, Donald Trump seemed to be on the money when he said that if elected, Hillary would use Syria to unleash WWIII.
To check out if that holds, lets start with an essential backup.
The Queen of War, at the final US presidential debate in Las Vegas: "" A no-fly zone [in Syria] can save lives and hasten the end of the conflict. ""
The Queen of War, in one of her 2013 speeches to Goldman Sachs, published by WikiLeaks: a no-fly zone would "" kill a lot of Syrians .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, speaking to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: a no-fly zone in Syria  would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia. ""
No-fly zone would require war with #Syria and #Russia   top US general https://t.co/veSy8uETak pic.twitter.com/zXyCmWjdXj
 RT America (@RT_America) September 22, 2016 Predictably, the Clinton (cash) machine has been relentless promoting Hillarys no-fly zone. Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.
Pass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted  as she already was in the past  when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.
I have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon  reflecting Dunfords comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens  consequences .
The Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two existential threats to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear first-strike  which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.
The relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual  terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust  exactly because Washington refuses to back down from first-strike  only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.
What Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved moderate Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control  with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.
Thats exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions,  things could get out of hand .
Also expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed mothership of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.
And if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Dutertes own pivot to China.
Say hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton  as in Obama III  presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.
A Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russias financial  weakness. 
The national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.
Besides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.
Moreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals  such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2. The Sarmat delivers monster warheads of 40 megatons; boasts a top speed of seven kilometers per second; and is able to outfox any anti-missile shield system anywhere.

3427.0,Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme Court?,"Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme Court?

The unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the looming face-off between the White House and the Senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of U.S. Supreme Court justices.

Legal scholars from both political parties renewed a call Tuesday to reconsider how much time justices spend on the high court. Many of them cited, with disapproval, a bruising and protracted clash building between President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate over when and how to fill Scalia's vacancy.

""The point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics,"" said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr. ""That didn't quite pan out.""

For years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the Supreme Court bench. The plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. That would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court — and align with the longer life spans of Americans since the nation's founding, they argue.

""It just sounds undemocratic,"" said Gabe Roth, executive director of an advocacy group called Fix the Court, about the lifetime court appointments. ""There's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. There have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting TV over the airwaves or over the Internet.""

Thomas Merrill, a law professor at Columbia University and a former deputy U.S. solicitor general (1987-1990), said he's been ""a little bit skeptical"" of the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices. But, Merrill said, his thinking has evolved.

""My current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the Supreme Court has become incredibly contentious, partisan, political, almost to the point where the political system freezes up, as we're witnessing right now with the Scalia death,"" Merrill said. ""It would be a good thing not to have the type of Armageddon it looks like we're about to have.""

Term-limit supporters point to a 2015 poll by Reuters/Ipsos, after high-profile rulings on Obama's health care legislation and same-sex marriage, that suggested two-thirds of respondents would support a 10-year limit on tenure on the Supreme Court.

But actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. Some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the Constitution. To do that, the House and Senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve. Another path would be for two-thirds of the states to call for a Constitutional Convention.

""Not likely, but possible,"" Kerr of George Washington University said. ""We'll see how this year goes. It may become unbearable with the president and the Senate duking it out every day.""",REAL,is it time to reconsider lifetime appointments to the supreme court the unexpected death of justice antonin

658.0,"Clinton has delegates to win Dem nomination, AP reports; Sanders questions tally","Hillary Clinton has earned enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, according to an Associated Press count released Monday night – an assessment swiftly challenged by primary rival Bernie Sanders and his campaign.

The AP released its updated tally, showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major party’s presidential ticket, on the eve of the last major day of primary voting.

The AP said Clinton reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee with a weekend victory in Puerto Rico and late burst of support from superdelegates. Those are party officials and officeholders, many of them eager to wrap up the primary, free to support whichever candidate they want.

""We really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating Donald Trump,"" said Nancy Worley, a superdelegate who chairs Alabama's Democratic Party and provided one of the last endorsements to put Clinton over the top.

""It's time to stand behind our presumptive candidate,"" said Michael Brown, one of two superdelegates from the District of Columbia who came forward in the past week to back Clinton before the city's June 14 primary. ""We shouldn't be acting like we are undecided when the people of America have spoken.""



Clinton touted the news at a Long Beach, Calif., campaign event, saying the campaign is now on the “brink of a historic … unprecedented moment.” But even she stressed that six states are yet to vote on Tuesday and urged supporters to cast their ballots for her in those contests.

The six states to vote Tuesday include New Jersey, North Dakota, New Mexico, Montana, California, and South Dakota.

Campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement: “This is an important milestone, but there are six states that are voting Tuesday, with millions of people heading to the polls, and Hillary Clinton is working to earn every vote. We look forward to Tuesday night, when Hillary Clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates.""

The Sanders campaign rejected the declaration that Clinton had clinched the party nod, citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention – as they are free to switch sides before then.

""There is nothing to concede,"" Sanders told KTVU late Monday at a rally in San Francisco. ""Secretary Clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the Democratic nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates. They vote on July 25th so right now our goal right at this moment [is to] do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow.""

Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs accused the media of “a rush to judgement"" and ""ignoring the Democratic National Committee’s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer.""

""Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump,"" Briggs said.

On Monday, Sanders' supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before California's primary and urged the senator to continue on despite the pronouncements. ""We're going to keep fighting until the last vote is counted,"" said Kristen Elliott, a Sanders' supporter from San Francisco who attended the rally.

Said another attendee, Patrick Bryant of San Francisco: ""It's what bookies do. They call fights before they're over.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed Clinton during an interview on “Good Morning America” before her home state’s primary.

""I'm a voter in California and I have voted for Hillary Clinton for president of the United States and proud to endorse her for that position,"" Pelosi said, though adding ""it's not over until it's over.""

Clinton has won 1,812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. The AP surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months, and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted.

All the superdelegates counted in Clinton's tally have unequivocally told the AP they will back her at the convention and not change their vote. Since the start of the AP's survey in late 2015, no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders.

Clinton’s presumptive victory Monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first White House campaign to Barack Obama. Back then, she famously noted her inability to ""shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling.""

Campaigning this time as the loyal successor to Obama, Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Vermont Sen. Sanders. He mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics-as-usual, even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009.

Clinton outpaced Sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in May. Following the results in Puerto Rico, it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2,383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates, according to the AP.

Clinton leads Sanders by more than 3 million cast votes, by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates. She also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories.

Echoing the sentiments of California Gov. Jerry Brown, who overcame a decades-long rivalry with the Clinton family to endorse her last week, many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat Trump in November.

Beyond winning over millions of Sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self-described democratic socialist, Clinton faces challenges as she turns toward November, including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her New York home while serving as secretary of state. Her deep unpopularity among Republicans has pushed many leery of Trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign.

""This to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive, liberal term, which is what a Clinton presidency would do,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan told the AP last week after he finally endorsed Trump, weeks after the New Yorker clinched the GOP nomination.

Yet Clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone, leaving Sanders behind and focusing on lacerating Trump. She said electing the billionaire businessman, who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks, would be a ""historic mistake.""

""He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,"" Clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness, previewing a brutal five-month general election campaign to come.

Even without the nomination, Sanders can claim ideological victory. His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade, Wall Street and campaign finance reform.

But she prevailed, in part, by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama. She won overwhelming support from women and minorities, catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse, delegate-rich states such as New York and Texas.

When Clinton launched her campaign last April, she did so largely unopposed, having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party's organizational and fundraising infrastructure. Vice President Joe Biden, seen as her most threatening rival, opted not to run in October.

Of the four opponents who did take her on, Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge. He caught fire among young voters and independents, his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire. His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring.

But Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates, hiring help from Obama's old team before launching her campaign. They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates.

Her victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation. Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead, which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast.

She now moves on to face Trump, whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected. The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton, debuting a nickname — ""Crooked Hillary"" — and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup.

After a long primary campaign, Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge.

""We're judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, not our ethnicity, not our religion,"" she said Saturday in Oxnard. ""So it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds. And I believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the United States.""

4865.0,"Trump says Obama born in US, ‘period’ – after new ‘birther’ dust-up","Donald Trump tried to tamp down a newly revived campaign dust-up Friday over his views on President Obama’s birthplace, declaring the president was born in the United States – “period” – after declining to make that statement earlier this week.

The Republican presidential nominee also tried to blame Hillary Clinton for starting the controversy back in 2008, which her team denies. He cast his remarks as a bid to put the issue to rest once and for all, at a time when his poll numbers are rising.

“Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,” Trump said in Washington, D.C. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.”

He spoke at his new Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., a visit that began with lengthy remarks from military supporters and veterans. He briefly addressed the “birther” issue at the end.

The statement comes after Trump’s response on the matter in an interview Wednesday revived the issue. In the interview with The Washington Post, Trump was asked whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S. ""I'll answer that question at the right time,"" Trump told the paper. ""I just don't want to answer it yet.""

Trump’s campaign spokesman, trying to calm the waters, said overnight the Republican candidate now believes Obama was born in the U.S. Campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Trump ""did a great service to the country"" by bringing closure to the debate.

""In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,"" Miller said.

But the Clinton campaign seized on Trump’s reluctance to address the issue in his Post interview.

Speaking shortly before Trump across town at the Black Women's Agenda Symposium, Clinton said Friday the Republican nominee was “feeding into” the “bigotry and bias that lurks in our country” – and should apologize.

“Barack Obama was born in America,” she said. “Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.”

Her campaign called his Friday comments ""disgraceful.""

The dust-up comes as Trump gains on Clinton in national and battleground state polls, even surpassing her in some states.

A new Fox News poll shows Clinton topping Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot nationally.

In the head-to-head matchup, Trump’s up by one point.

Both candidates were fundraising Friday after events in Washington. Clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail, after criticizing some Trump supporters last Friday as ""deplorables"" and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia.

She used the birther issue to try and go back on offense.

While Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so-called ""birther"" controversy. Critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nation’s first black president.

Trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the ""birther"" issue.

The Trump campaign’s statement late Thursday claimed that Clinton launched the “birther” movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008.

""Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,"" the statement said. ""This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.""

Clinton has long denied the claim, and fact-checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue. Rather, Trump’s comments appear to refer to reports that Clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning Obama’s citizenship.

Yet former McClatchy D.C. bureau chief James Asher said on Twitter Friday that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in fact “told me in person” that Obama was born in Kenya.

Obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department.

In 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane.

The form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar.

At the White House on Friday, Obama declined to comment at length on the issue, saying he’s got other business to attend to – and is confident about where he was born.

4031.0,"MH370: If debris is part of missing plane, what's next?","(CNN) If confirmed to be from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, could a small portion of plane wing discovered on an Indian Ocean island be the clue investigators need to unlock one of aviation's biggest mysteries?

On the surface, the discovery on a Reunion Island beach is just what investigators have been waiting for -- the first physical piece of evidence since the flight vanished en route to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard.

According to a source close to the investigation, Boeing investigators are confident the debris comes from a 777 aircraft -- although no one is yet saying the part came from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

""It's only a very small part of the aircraft, but it could be a very important piece of evidence,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said Friday

Because Reunion Island is a French territory, the debris has been flown to France, where aviation safety bureau the BEA has taken responsibility for its testing and analysis.

The flaperon arrived in Toulouse over the weekend, but the fact that so many different countries and groups are involved in the search for the missing flight has complicated and delayed the situation somewhat.

Aviation experts are not expected to begin examining the part until Wednesday, and it is unclear how long their analysis will take.

Teams from each of the nations taking part in the search are expected to attend. Malaysia Airlines is sending investigators to France and a second team to Reunion, an airline official said.

Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said those involved would be careful to make sure all tests were carried out scientifically, and completely by the book.

She said that while ""everyone knows that it most likely is from MH370,"" investigators do not want to jump to conclusions.

""They're going to do a lot of analysis on the part, everything from X-rays to sonograms,"" Schiavo said. ""Then when they finally cut it open (looking for serial numbers and part numbers), it has to be filmed, all the parties to the investigation -- there are seven nations in this investigation -- they all need to be present.""

David Gallo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, agreed: ""That's the way the BEA -- the French version of the NTSB -- works; they will be very careful about what they say and don't say.

""It's going to be scientific. It's a piece of evidence in a criminal investigation at this point, so they're going to take it apart bit by bit.""

Planes are stamped with serial numbers to allow parts to be identified and matched to a specific model and aircraft.

A source close to the investigation said Boeing investigators feel confident the piece comes from a 777, based on photos that have been analyzed, and a stenciled number that corresponds to a 777 component.

Another source told CNN's Rene Marsh that Boeing engineers have seen a part number in photos. A parts supplier confirmed 10-60754-1133 is a part number on a seal associated with 777s.

Images of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the right-wing flaperon from a Boeing 777. A flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft.

""If the part numbers that are stamped on the pieces of the plane still survive, it literally could be a phone call to Boeing or the parts indices to see if it belongs to a 777. And if it belongs to a 777, it is MH370,"" said Schiavo.

Of the five accidents involving Boeing 777s, MH370 is the only one in which debris hasn't been recovered, Schiavo said.

If the identifying numbers are missing, more tests will need to be conducted on the part to determine its origin.

A French laboratory that the BEA could use has the capacity to ""identify very quickly"" which plane the debris belongs to, and what happened to it, a source close to the French investigation said.

Australian investigators, heavily involved for some time in the search, said they are looking at the barnacles attached to the discovered part that could allow marine biologists to tell how long it has been floating.

Truss said that he understood ""the photographs that are available are of such detail that it may be possible to make an identification without further physical examination.""

What does the condition of the debris indicate?

Through the French laboratory near Toulouse, ""engineers would be able to identify quickly whether the plane exploded in the air or whether it broke when hitting the water,"" the source close to the French investigation said.

Images of the component appear to show a small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and a ragged horizontal tear across the back.

One group of independent observers has said that the damage to the flaperon should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the air.

The rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean, some members of the group, led by American Mobile Satellite Corp. co-founder Mike Exner, wrote in a preliminary assessment.

But the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a high-speed, steep, spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off, the group said.

If the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water, the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached, the group says.

However, Tom Ballantyne of Orient Aviation magazine said the condition of debris could indicate if the plane met a catastrophic end. Charring, for example, could indicate an explosion, he said.

Sciavo said investigators would be on the look out for tell-tale signs of what caused the crash: ""It's possible to find positive evidence of a criminal act, or, of course they could find the absence of that.

""If they find characteristic pitting in the wing structure, in the metal or the composite, that indicates there was some sort of explosive device, or if they find residue, which is not likely (after) this long in he ocean,"" she said.

""But they'll probably not be able to tell why the plane went down -- only that it did, and the manner in which it did.""

To learn more, the flight data recorders -- or so-called black boxes -- will be crucial.

If it is from MH370, will the main search area move?

Truss told a press conference Friday that the discovery of the debris in Reunion was ""consistent with some of the modeling we've done.""

""We remain confident that we're searching in the right place,"" he said.

He said authorities would ""continue to concentrate our efforts on seeking to locate the aircraft in the identified area.""

The current search is focused deep in the ocean off Western Australia, along an arc considered by investigators to be the most likely area the plane went down if it turned back toward Malaysia, as indicated by data, and stayed in the air before running out of fuel.

The southern end of the search area was the main focus, Truss said, but during the winter months weather conditions at that latitude were poor.

Once that search was completed, he said, searchers would focus efforts on a second identified area of interest.

If it's part of the plane, is it more likely the main section will be found?

Truss said that if the flaperon is proven to be from MH370, its discovery did not ""provide a great deal of help in specifically identifying where the aircraft is.""

If confirmed, however, the find is likely to give investigators further belief that other pieces of the plane have been carried by currents to the same region.

Will debris lead to a rethinking of past theories?

Thomas said, if anything, the location of the potential debris confirms modeling from the University of Western Australia that showed material from the plane could wash up around Reunion between 12 to 24 months after the plane's disappearance.

Despite the modeling, no one had been searching in that area, he said, because of the vast nature of the Indian Ocean and the multitude of factors that meant finding anything would be matter of luck and time.

""It was a matter of waiting for something to wash up,"" he said.

However, Truss said, a positive identification with MH370 would rule out the some of the more left-field theories that the aircraft was ""secretly parked in some hidden place"" on land.",REAL,cnn if confirmed to be from missing malaysia airlines flight  could a small portion of plane wing discovered on an indian ocean island be the clue investigators need to unlock one of aviations biggest mysteries on the surface the discovery on a reunion island beach is just what investigators have been waiting for  the first physical piece of evidence since the flight vanished en route to beijing in march  with  people aboard according to a source close to the investigation boeing investigators are confident the debris comes from a  aircraft  although no one is yet saying the part came from malaysia airlines flight  its only a very small part of the aircraft but it could be a very important piece of evidence australian deputy prime minister warren truss said friday because reunion island is a french territory the debris has been flown to france where aviation safety bureau the bea has taken responsibility for its testing and analysis the flaperon arrived in toulouse over the weekend but the fact that so many different countries and groups are involved in the search for the missing flight has complicated and delayed the situation somewhat aviation experts are not expected to begin examining the part until wednesday and it is unclear how long their analysis will take teams from each of the nations taking part in the search are expected to attend malaysia airlines is sending investigators to france and a second team to reunion an airline official said mary schiavo a cnn aviation analyst and former inspector general of the us department of transportation said those involved would be careful to make sure all tests were carried out scientifically and completely by the book she said that while everyone knows that it most likely is from mh investigators do not want to jump to conclusions theyre going to do a lot of analysis on the part everything from xrays to sonograms schiavo said then when they finally cut it open looking for serial numbers and part numbers it has to be filmed all the parties to the investigation  there are seven nations in this investigation  they all need to be present david gallo of the woods hole oceanographic institution agreed thats the way the bea  the french version of the ntsb  works they will be very careful about what they say and dont say its going to be scientific its a piece of evidence in a criminal investigation at this point so theyre going to take it apart bit by bit planes are stamped with serial numbers to allow parts to be identified and matched to a specific model and aircraft a source close to the investigation said boeing investigators feel confident the piece comes from a  based on photos that have been analyzed and a stenciled number that corresponds to a  component another source told cnns rene marsh that boeing engineers have seen a part number in photos a parts supplier confirmed  is a part number on a seal associated with s images of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the rightwing flaperon from a boeing  a flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft if the part numbers that are stamped on the pieces of the plane still survive it literally could be a phone call to boeing or the parts indices to see if it belongs to a  and if it belongs to a  it is mh said schiavo of the five accidents involving boeing s mh is the only one in which debris hasnt been recovered schiavo said if the identifying numbers are missing more tests will need to be conducted on the part to determine its origin a french laboratory that the bea could use has the capacity to identify very quickly which plane the debris belongs to and what happened to it a source close to the french investigation said australian investigators heavily involved for some time in the search said they are looking at the barnacles attached to the discovered part that could allow marine biologists to tell how long it has been floating truss said that he understood the photographs that are available are of such detail that it may be possible to make an identification without further physical examination what does the condition of the debris indicate through the french laboratory near toulouse engineers would be able to identify quickly whether the plane exploded in the air or whether it broke when hitting the water the source close to the french investigation said images of the component appear to show a small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and a ragged horizontal tear across the back one group of independent observers has said that the damage to the flaperon should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the air the rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean some members of the group led by american mobile satellite corp cofounder mike exner wrote in a preliminary assessment but the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a highspeed steep spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off the group said if the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached the group says however tom ballantyne of orient aviation magazine said the condition of debris could indicate if the plane met a catastrophic end charring for example could indicate an explosion he said sciavo said investigators would be on the look out for telltale signs of what caused the crash its possible to find positive evidence of a criminal act or of course they could find the absence of that if they find characteristic pitting in the wing structure in the metal or the composite that indicates there was some sort of explosive device or if they find residue which is not likely after this long in he ocean she said but theyll probably not be able to tell why the plane went down  only that it did and the manner in which it did to learn more the flight data recorders  or socalled black boxes  will be crucial if it is from mh will the main search area move truss told a press conference friday that the discovery of the debris in reunion was consistent with some of the modeling weve done we remain confident that were searching in the right place he said he said authorities would continue to concentrate our efforts on seeking to locate the aircraft in the identified area the current search is focused deep in the ocean off western australia along an arc considered by investigators to be the most likely area the plane went down if it turned back toward malaysia as indicated by data and stayed in the air before running out of fuel the southern end of the search area was the main focus truss said but during the winter months weather conditions at that latitude were poor once that search was completed he said searchers would focus efforts on a second identified area of interest if its part of the plane is it more likely the main section will be found truss said that if the flaperon is proven to be from mh its discovery did not provide a great deal of help in specifically identifying where the aircraft is if confirmed however the find is likely to give investigators further belief that other pieces of the plane have been carried by currents to the same region will debris lead to a rethinking of past theories thomas said if anything the location of the potential debris confirms modeling from the university of western australia that showed material from the plane could wash up around reunion between  to  months after the planes disappearance despite the modeling no one had been searching in that area he said because of the vast nature of the indian ocean and the multitude of factors that meant finding anything would be matter of luck and time it was a matter of waiting for something to wash up he said however truss said a positive identification with mh would rule out the some of the more leftfield theories that

10257.0,GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014,"GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014   Source: Higgins News Network 
A newly released Podesta email reveals that Google CEO Eric Schmidt contacted the Hillary campaign in 2014 to begin their partnership in sponsoring Clinton’s campaign run for President in 2016. 
The revelations come from a memo in the email sent to Cherry Mills which was then forwarded Robby Mook, John Podesta, and David Plouffe. 
Schmidt’s memo outlines an overall campaign strategy for Hillary, Schmidt’s vision for a massive cloud-based AI integrate software program and also reveals that Google colluded with the Obama administration in the 2012 election. 
The memo goes on to layout plans to construct a massive cloud-based database, along with programs that leveraged machine learning (aka Artificial Intelligence) that would be used to first to track users online to create a partial digital voter ids. 
Those partial digital ids contain a collection of attributes about the users online behavior which Schmidt explains will all eventually be tied to a real voter id file by leveraging machine learning. 
Schmidt details the procurement of a development team and the use of outline money to create software that will be connected to users smart phones on 2016 that would allow volunteers the ability to access any and all voter data. 
Schmidt also outlines ideas for the using the integrated tool to monitor social media and news stories to help promote positive articles and target the source of “rumors” and negative articles. 
Given Google’s massive collection of personal user data combined with previous revelations that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg and Facebook COO were colluding with Hillary raises series concerns above user privacy, media manipulation and host of other problems. 
That combined with the fact that just about every other Silicon Valley company and executive is behind the Hillary Campaign makes this a chilling memo that should be getting much more attention than it is.

Cheryl, I have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and I havescheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but dolet me know if this is a helpful process for you all. Thanks !! Eric 

Notes for a 2016 Democratic CampaignEric Schmidt 
Here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012campaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position toexecute well for 2016. 
1. Size, Structure and Timing 
Lets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paidemployees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceasesoperation four days after November 8, 2016 . The structure includes aChairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and aPresident who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements,systems and building and managing the organization. 
Every day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaignright after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. 
2. Location 
The campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly youngand hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very largehiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic,smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full ofdistractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhereguarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. 
The key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work foryou. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all goodexamples of a large, blue state city to base in. 
Employees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find lowcost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis.This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. 
The computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services(AWS) . All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smartphones along with credit card reader s. 
3. The pieces of a Campaign 
a) The Field 
Its important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy andempowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up thesystems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people.Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states.There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the humansystems. T he field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get outthe vote programs. 
For organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as aworkflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build asimple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integrationas the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing isreally about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure andtrack all of it. 
There are many other crucial early investments needed in the field:determining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling toconfirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protectionprograms at the state level. 
b) The Voter 
Key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates allthat is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify,meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easilyspeak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get thevoter videos and other answers to areas they care about (“the benefits ofACA to you” etc.) 
The scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potentialvoter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voterand the information we have to offer. 
c) Digital 
A large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods toconnect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spreadgood news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will domuch of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partnersto pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. 
d) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling 
New tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earnedand social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable inreach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and othersurveys. 
Build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors , andmodel how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us aboutthe origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme .Connect polling into this in some way. 
Find a way to do polling online and not on phones. 
e) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resourceoptimization tools 
For each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote.Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributesof the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn outand why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches workwell. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the mostimportant factors for turnout, and preference. 
It should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcomingdatabases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurementpurposes. 
The analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set ofvendors. 
f) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online 
The database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter recordsand i s maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud ).The code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc. ) is unlikely to be used, andreplaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database andintermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter. 
Quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities withthe actual voter file with high confidence . The key unit of the campaignis a “voter”, and each and every record is viewable and updatable byvolunteers in search of more accurate information . 
In the case w here we can’t identify the specific human , we can still have a partial digital voter id , for a person or “probable-person” with attributesthat we can identify and use to targe t. As they respond we can eventuallymatch to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key iseventually matched to a real person . 
The Rules 
Its important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there beno special interests in the financing structure . This means that allvendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure noone is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflictsof interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the auditshould include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from thecampaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.) 
The KEY things 
a) early b uild of an integrated development team and recognition that thisis an entire system that has to be managed as suchb) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choiceof vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused.c) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smartphone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, andallows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone).d) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build thefield, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful andperfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know aboutmedia placement, TV versus other media and digital media .

2586.0,Israel stole classified US information and used it to help congressional Republicans,"The Wall Street Journal's Adam Entous dropped a huge story Tuesday morning: Israel acquired classified US information while spying on the Iranian nuclear negotiations, and leaked the stolen information about the emerging deal to American lawmakers in an attempt to sabotage the Obama administration's outreach to Tehran.

This is yet another disaster for US-Israel relations. But that's not because Israel acquired classified US information, which honestly isn't that surprising. What's really outrageous is that Israel used the information in a deliberate attempt to manipulate American politics.

No one should be shocked that Israel was spying on the talks. A certain degree of espionage is pretty par for the course in world politics, even among allies. Indeed, as Entous' story repeatedly makes clear, American officials expected Israel to snoop on them. In fact, according to Entous, the US found out about the Israeli spying because it was already spying on Israel:

But there is a real scandal here, and that's Israel using stolen intelligence as part of a deliberate campaign of messing around with American partisan politics. That's why the White House is angry: ""It is one thing for the U.S. and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy,"" a senior US official told Entous.

If Entous' reporting is correct, the Israeli government used the leaked information to help Republicans build support for new sanctions among Democrats, which would be necessary to overcome Obama's veto. Israel was using stolen information to help Mitch McConnell and John Boehner foment a Democratic rebellion against the president.

This is the same reason Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress about Iran infuriated so many Democrats this month. The problem wasn't that Netanyahu was invited to Congress; it's that the speech was coordinated with Republicans behind the president's back in a deliberate attempt to undermine his Iran policy.



The spying/briefing allegations suggest the speech was part of a much broader campaign to help Republicans pass new sanctions, a particularly dangerous move by Netanyahu at a time when Israel is at risk of becoming a partisan issue in America.

Allies really aren't supposed to do this sort of thing. Playing partisan domestic politics — and doing it with classified information, no less — positions Israel as the Republican Party's ally, not America's. The fact that Republican interests line up with Israel's in this case doesn't justify crossing these lines.

None of this is to say the Netanyahu government has to just sit down and accept an American Iran policy it opposes. It's perfectly within bounds for Netanyahu to publicly oppose the ongoing negotiations in which international powers are seeking to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for relief on its crippling economic sanctions. It's fine for Netanyahu to lobby the French, who have an important role in the negotiations, to push for more stringent limits on Iran's nuclear program. That's all normal international politics.",REAL,the wall street journals adam entous dropped a huge story tuesday morning israel acquired classified us information while spying on the iranian nuclear

4045.0,"""America has a simple ideology"": how one of Russia's top US experts explains America","The United States comes up constantly when you talk to Russians about their country's place in the world. But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expect.

In the US, the common view is that Russians feel aggrieved by the loss of the Soviet Union and all the respect that came with being a global superpower. Russia's acts of aggression in Europe, in this telling, are all about challenging the American-led order as a way to prove Russia's might and importance. This aggression is wildly popular among Russians, many Americans believe, because it makes them feel patriotic and powerful to bully the West, and particularly the US, which they blame for Russia's problems.

""Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991, but America still seems to have them on""

There is certainly truth to this, but it's just a piece of the truth. Rather, when you speak to influential people across institutions and the political spectrum in Russia, as Amanda Taub and I did during a recent reporting trip there, the story you hear over and over is one of Russia's fundamental weakness. And you hear a preoccupation with the United States that goes far beyond what even many Americans, who are famously narcissistic about our country, would expect.

In this telling, Moscow capitulated at the end of the Cold War, and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful United States. But an irrationally aggressive America has instead sought repeatedly to weaken, control, or even destroy Russia. Their country, in this view, is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful West. Its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive. And Moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear Russians cite over and over.

This is the version of history you hear in Russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists, from pro-Putin ideologues and anti-Putin ideologues, even from members of the pro-Western political opposition who support what they believe be to a Western agenda of weakening Russia.

There's a quote that speaks perfectly to this Russian worldview — and how Americans misunderstand it — in the most recent issue of Russia in Global Affairs, a Russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of Russia's foreign policy establishment. The quote is from a Q&A with Vladimir Lukin, a prominent Russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the US:

Interviewer: In his 1994 book ""Diplomacy,"" Henry Kissinger writes that ""integrating Russia into the international system is a key task"" for the United States. But as he was saying this, the Americans were actually pushing Moscow away with their policy. Why? Vladimir Lukin: It is in the genes. America has a simple ideology – that there is only one truth in the world, that truth is held by God, and God created the United States to be an embodiment of that truth. So the Americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy. Only after that will everything be well. This ideology has a strong influence on their policy. A wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert, Kissinger had good reason to call such politicians ""Trotskyites"" for advocating a world revolution, albeit in their own way, but always in the front and in shining armor. This is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times, not only the United States.

Lukin is hardly seen as an anti-American hard-liner in Russia — rather, he's considered to be an objective expert on the United States and a highly professional diplomat. He is a founding member of the liberal opposition party Yabloko. That he would get the United States so obviously wrong — what Americans would call defending democracy and human rights, he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of ""advocating a world revolution"" — is troubling. But his view is a common one, and that tells you a great deal.

The interviewer's response is similarly telling: ""So Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991, but America still seems to have them on. The Soviet Union is gone, but the policy against it is not.""

This narrative of an inherently aggressive America is one we heard over and over in Moscow, not just from people who support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aggressive, anti-American policies but even from those who oppose them. In this view, American politics and policies are bent on, and in many ways driven by, a hatred of Russia and desire to destroy or at least control it. Russia has had no choice but to meet American aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclear-capable missiles in Europe or arming eastern Ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by American-backed fascists, if only to deter the US from further actions that could lead to all-out war.

It's not hard to poke holes in this Russian worldview. As Stephen Sestanovich, a longtime senior State Department official who helped engineer the Clinton administration's Russia policies, wrote in a recent article for the American Interest, even the ""pragmatic"" Russian case for annexing Crimea in March 2014 makes little strategic sense:

Yet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in Russia who oppose anti-Western policies. One foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the West sighed to us that it would be impossible because Hillary Clinton, whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally anti-Russian, would soon take office. At another meeting, a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the US would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in Moscow.

As Sestanovich writes in his essay, ""The idea that the United States aims at a 'color revolution' in Moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official Russian rhetoric."" This is more than paranoia or government propaganda; it is the accepted worldview: that Russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational United States.

Lukin, at another point in his Q&A, lamented that the US had rejected Moscow's gestures at cooperation in the 1990s and instead sought to surround Russia with a hostile NATO alliance, thus forcing Russia into a defensive crouch and creating today's tensions. ""It was the biggest mistake the West made,"" he said, ""and gradually led to the current situation.""

These fears about America are likely to worsen in Russia if Hillary Clinton becomes president; many people told us she is seen by many Russians, especially Russian policymakers, as unbendingly hostile to Moscow and bent on the Putin government's destruction.

""Hillary is the worst option of any president,"" Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential Russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank, told us.

""Many people here believe that [she and her team] will try to come back to the line of the 1990s to encourage Russia into an internal transformation,"" Lukyanov added. ""Not by force, of course, but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new one.""

united states that goes far beyond what even many americans who are famously narcissistic about our country would expect in this telling moscow capitulated at the end of the cold war and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful united states but an irrationally aggressive america has instead sought repeatedly to weaken control or even destroy russia their country in this view is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful west its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive and moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear russians cite over and over this is the version of history you hear in russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists from proputin ideologues and antiputin ideologues even from members of the prowestern political opposition who support what they believe be to a western agenda of weakening russia theres a quote that speaks perfectly to this russian worldview  and how americans misunderstand it  in the most recent issue of russia in global affairs a russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of russias foreign policy establishment the quote is from a qa with vladimir lukin a prominent russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the us interviewer in his  book diplomacy henry kissinger writes that integrating russia into the international system is a key task for the united states but as he was saying this the americans were actually pushing moscow away with their policy why vladimir lukin it is in the genes america has a simple ideology  that there is only one truth in the world that truth is held by god and god created the united states to be an embodiment of that truth so the americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy only after that will everything be well this ideology has a strong influence on their policy a wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert kissinger had good reason to call such politicians trotskyites for advocating a world revolution albeit in their own way but always in the front and in shining armor this is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times not only the united states lukin is hardly seen as an antiamerican hardliner in russia  rather hes considered to be an objective expert on the united states and a highly professional diplomat he is a founding member of the liberal opposition party yabloko that he would get the united states so obviously wrong  what americans would call defending democracy and human rights he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of advocating a world revolution  is troubling but his view is a common one and that tells you a great deal the interviewers response is similarly telling so russia took off its ideological blinders in  but america still seems to have them on the soviet union is gone but the policy against it is not this narrative of an inherently aggressive america is one we heard over and over in moscow not just from people who support russian president vladimir putin and his aggressive antiamerican policies but even from those who oppose them in this view american politics and policies are bent on and in many ways driven by a hatred of russia and desire to destroy or at least control it russia has had no choice but to meet american aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclearcapable missiles in europe or arming eastern ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by americanbacked fascists if only to deter the us from further actions that could lead to allout war its not hard to poke holes in this russian worldview as stephen sestanovich a longtime senior state department official who helped engineer the clinton administrations russia policies wrote in a recent article for the american interest even the pragmatic russian case for annexing crimea in march  makes little strategic sense yet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in russia who oppose antiwestern policies one foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the west sighed to us that it would be impossible because hillary clinton whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally antirussian would soon take office at another meeting a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the us would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in moscow as sestanovich writes in his essay the idea that the united states aims at a color revolution in moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official russian rhetoric this is more than paranoia or government propaganda it is the accepted worldview that russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational united states lukin at another point in his qa lamented that the us had rejected moscows gestures at cooperation in the s and instead sought to surround russia with a hostile nato alliance thus forcing russia into a defensive crouch and creating todays tensions it was the biggest mistake the west made he said and gradually led to the current situation these fears about america are likely to worsen in russia if hillary clinton becomes president many people told us she is seen by many russians especially russian policymakers as unbendingly hostile to moscow and bent on the putin governments destruction hillary is the worst option of any president fyodor lukyanov an influential russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank told us many people here believe that she and her team will try to come back to the line of the s to encourage russia into an internal transformation lukyanov added not by force of course but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new one watch what most people miss

4632.0,Poll shows Trump made up 13 points in under 2 weeks — now he likes polls again,"While Trump’s edge is just 1 point — which is well within the margin of error — the Republican candidate has made up 13 points in under two weeks.

Trump — who used to read off every poll he led during rallies but had begun to call them inaccurate after he started to decline — has decided he likes them again, or at least he likes this one.

But not everyone wants to capitalize on the poll. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich called the new poll an “absurdity.”

At this point in 2012, Mitt Romney led President Obama by 1 point.

The daily tracking poll was conducted Oct. 27-30, 2016, and included 1,128 likely voters.

71.0,"Chaos on House floor as Dems, Republicans clash over LGBT proposal","The chaotic scene -- accompanied by loud chants of ""shame, shame, shame"" -- included one Democrat facing off with the second-highest-ranking House Republican, accusations of foul play and a series of insults being traded openly on the House floor.

The clash began over a yearly spending bill to fund military construction projects and the Veterans Administration. Because the bill covers spending on federal contracts, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, attached what he said was a one-sentence proposal to uphold President Barack Obama's executive order protecting LGBT workers from being fired. The amendment had enough votes to pass but the vote was held open, and several Republicans changed their position just before the vote was officially closed.

""They literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality. We won this vote,"" a visibly irate Maloney told reporters.

Maloney accused House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of ""twisting arms."" Maloney and other Democrats told CNN that once the vote board showed the measure had 217 votes -- enough to pass with just eight seconds left in the vote -- McCarthy personally approached House GOP members to switch their ""yes"" votes to ""no"" as the presiding officer kept the vote open for several minutes past the standard five-minute period.

A senior House Republican leadership aide told CNN that it wasn't just McCarthy -- all the top GOP leaders were working to defeat Maloney's amendment because they were concerned that if passed, it would jeopardize the spending bill. When Maloney walked over to McCarthy to appeal to him to allow the measure to pass, saying plenty of Republicans backed it, he said McCarthy told him ""get on my own side of the aisle."" He answered back to the majority leader, ""What side am I supposed to stand on to support equality?"" One Republican who witnessed the exchange said Maloney walked over to the GOP side of the chamber and was ""taunting Republican members"" and had his arms up in the air as he was trying to talk to them about letting his proposal pass. Roughly a dozen Republicans approached Maloney as the vote was extended and told him they disagreed with their own leadership's tactics to work to defeat the measure. California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who was standing with Maloney, told reporters that Illinois GOP Rep. Bob Dold told the New York Democrat ""this is bulls***."" As the scene unfolded, reporters outside the chamber could hear jeers as the gavel came down with a new 212-213 vote tally, defeating the measure. No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer began shouting and calling out Republicans for not following the traditional practice of coming to the well of the House floor to change their votes, saying they instead remained in their seats to avoid being identified. Afterward, Democrats produced a list of seven House Republicans, including the head of the GOP's campaign arm, Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden, who initially backed Maloney's proposal before switching their votes. The other Republicans, according to a floor vote printout by Democratic staff, were Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, Rep. David Valadao, R-California, Rep. Mimi Walters, R-California, and Rep. David Young, R-Iowa. Hoyer's staff also tweeted out the list of names, calling their votes ""shameful."" CNN has reached out to all seven House Republicans who changed their vote Thursday morning. So far, only Poliquin has responded about why he decided to vote no for the measure after originally registering support for it, defending his vote in a written statement to CNN. ""I am outraged that political opponents or members of the press would claim or insinuate that I cast a vote due to pressure or party politics,"" Poliquin wrote. ""No one controls my vote. I work hard only for the people of Maine's 2nd Congressional District."" Poliquin added, ""I abhor discrimination in any form and at any place."" ""They are bigots, they are haters,"" a seething Democratic Rep. Steve Israel said about House Republicans. He then immediately worked to tie House Republicans to Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, saying Trump ""is very proud of House Republicans today."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who as the speaker doesn't typically vote, was holding his weekly news conference and missed the fracas. When asked about what happened, he told reporters he didn't have any details about who may have changed their votes, but made it clear he opposed the Democrats' proposal. ""The states should do this. The federal government shouldn't stick its nose in this business,"" Ryan said. Maloney vowed, ""These things are going to be remembered"" and told reporters he planned to try to push similar measures on other legislation. ""The people who stood in the schoolhouse door are going to have this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers, and I hope they can live with themselves,"" Maloney said. ""I hope they can look their kids in the eye and sleep OK tonight because what they did is as disgusting as one of the famous episodes in American history where we've seen people stand on the wrong side of the march toward Selma, or stand in the schoolhouse door when someone was trying to get an equal education.""",REAL,the chaotic scene  accompanied by loud chants of shame shame shame  included

1108.0,"Clinton, Sanders accuse Trump of inciting violence","(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both accused Donald Trump of inciting violence, with the former secretary of state calling him ""bigoted"" and alleging he had perpetrated ""political arson,"" while the Vermont senator labeled him a ""pathological liar"" at a town hall on Sunday night.

""It is clear that Donald Trump is running a very cynical campaign pitting groups of Americans against one another. He is trafficking in hate and fear,"" Clinton said during the event at Ohio State University hosted by CNN and TV One. ""He actually incites violence in the way he urges his audience on, talking about punching people, offering to pay legal bills.""

Clinton charged that Trump was guilty of a case of ""political arson"" by throwing fuel on political divisions in the country.

""He has been incredibly bigoted towards so many groups,"" she continued. ""You don't make America great by tearing down everything that made America great.""

Clinton followed Sanders at the town hall moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and TV One's Roland Martin. Sanders and Clinton are making closing arguments to voters in their increasingly contentious Democratic nominating marathon, two days before five states vote in crucial primaries that could set the tone for the rest of the contest.

On Sunday night, Clinton's comments followed Sanders' own sharp criticism of Trump.

""I hesitate to say this because I really don't like to disparage public officials, but Donald Trump is a pathological liar,"" Sanders said.

Sanders also blasted Trump for saying that he might pay the legal fees of a man charged with punching a protester at one of his rallies, adding that doing so was tantamount to ""inciting violence.""

""I would hope Mr. Trump tones it down big time and tells his supporters that violence is not acceptable in the American political process,"" Sanders said.

In one of the most dramatic moments of the night, Clinton was asked by audience member Ricky Jackson -- who spent 39 years in jail for a murder he did not commit, including a period on death row -- to justify her support for the death penalty in some cases.

She replied that the states had proven themselves incapable of carrying out fair trials and said she would ""breathe a sigh of relief"" if the Supreme Court and the states began to eliminate capital punishment.

But she argued that there was a case for a ""very limited use"" of the death penalty in cases of ""horrific"" terrorist crimes in federal cases like the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 during her husband's administration.

Speaking directly to Jackson, however, she told him, ""I just can't even imagine what you went through and how terrible those days and nights must have been for all those years. All of us are so regretful that you or any person had to go through what you did.""

Jackson, who is an undecided voter, was then asked by Martin if he was satisfied with Clinton's response. He replied, ""Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you, senator.""

The town hall took place in the wake of Sanders' surprise victory in the Michigan primary last week, which raised his hopes of competing with Clinton across Midwestern Rust Belt states.

They faced questions from Buckeye State voters as they vie for the support of blue collar and minority voters who underpin the Democratic coalition.

It also came at the end of a weekend filled with violence and disruption of Trump rallies, in which the real estate mogul pointed the finger at Sanders for the unruliness.

But Sanders said Sunday night, ""Our campaign does not believe and never will encourage anybody to disrupt anything.""

He added that people have the right to protest even though he said other candidates' rallies shouldn't be disrupted.

""Trump has to get on the TV and tell his supporters that violence in the political process in America is not acceptable, end of discussion,"" he said.

At the same time, Sanders dismissed the idea that he was responsible for the actions of all his supporters.

""Millions of people voted for me. If I have to take responsibility for everybody who voted for me, it would be a very difficult life,"" Sanders said

The town hall was also an opportunity for the two Democratic candidates to highlight their differences even if they didn't meet face to face.

One questioner, Amit Majmudar, a radiologist born to Indian immigrant parents and Ohio's poet laureate, told each one that he had one mission at the ballot box, to keep Trump out of office and asked what each would do to defeat Trump.

Clinton argued that she was the best candidate to take on Trump because she was ""the only candidate who has gotten more votes than Trump"" in the 2016 contests held so far.

She added that she was building a broad-based campaign to convince people that this was the highest-stakes election they had ever been involved in, explicitly because Trump was likely to be the Republican nominee.

And she said that the fact that Republicans had been ""after me"" for 25 years meant there wasn't anything the GOP had not already dug up about her.

""I am not new to the national arena and I think whoever goes up against Donald Trump better be ready,"" she said.

Clinton also said that there would be many arguments that Democrats could make against Trump but that she didn't want to ""spill the beans right now.""

""I am having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump,"" Clinton said, though she declined to name any other than Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who she said had done so publicly.

Sanders, for his part, pivoted to his Democratic opponent on the issue of trade, which is emerging as a key theme on both sides of the aisle in the 2016 presidential race.

He lashed out at ""corporately written trade agreements,"" which he said were designed to shut down U.S factories and pay people ""pennies an hour"" in China and Mexico.

""One of the very strong differences between Secretary Clinton and myself -- she has supported almost all of those trade agreements, I have vigorously opposed (them),"" he charged.

At one point while talking about trade though, Sanders slipped in another backhanded slap at Trump. Defending his position on trade, Sanders said that he did not want to cut off the United States from global trade flows.

""Nobody is talking about building a wall around the United States,"" Sanders said, before trailing off when people in the audience started chuckling. ""Oh, I beg your pardon, there is one guy who is talking about building a wall. Let me rephrase it: no rational person is talking about building a wall.""

During Clinton's appearance, she sought to match her rival's rhetoric on trade after she was asked by a laid-off steel worker how she would deal with alleged dumping of steel in the U.S. market by foreign nations.

""I believe that the dumping is illegal and we have to summon up the political and the legal arguments to take it on,"" Clinton said, specifically accusing China of the practice. Other nations, including Italy, South Korea and India have in recent months been accused of dumping corrosion-resistant steel in the U.S. market.

The town hall segment with each candidate concluded with a few more personal questions.

Clinton was asked to elaborate on her recent comment that she's not a natural politician like her husband Bill Clinton or President Barack Obama.

Clinton turned the question into a way of stressing her particular skills while admitting her liabilities, saying she had worked hard to become a better politician but wanted to be more than just good at campaigning.

""I don't want to be hired to be a constant candidate, I want to be hired to be the president because I think that I, in this moment in our country's history, bring the combination of skills and understanding and experience that can be really put to work immediately to do all parts of the job,"" she said.

She also said that the campaign skills of her husband and Obama are ""poetry,"" relating that ""I get carried away and I have seen them a million times."" She added that such stump skills were not her forte.

Sanders, asked which ideological opponents he got along with the best, mentioned Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, even though he's someone who Democrats have pilloried as a climate-change denier.

Though Sanders has been scoring some points on trade, Clinton has so far built a more diverse constituency resting especially on African-American voters and Hispanics and appears to have the edge going into Tuesday's primaries in Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.

Still, Sanders has high hopes of good results in the Midwest in particular and has been driving his message that the economy is stacked against working Americans and underpinned by a corrupt political system.

Tuesday's primaries are hugely significant because they make up the third-highest allocation of delegates available on a single day in the Democratic presidential race.

A new poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC published on Sunday shows Clinton leading Sanders for the three biggest prizes available on Tuesday. She is up 61% to 34% on Sanders in Florida, leads him by 58% to 38% in Ohio and by six points in Illinois.

Sanders will be hoping that last Tuesday's results are an omen for this week after he went into the Michigan primary trailing badly in polls but still managed to best Clinton.

The former secretary of state, however, is looking to further bolster her lead in delegates over Sanders on Tuesday.

According to CNN estimates, Clinton has 1,244 delegates (including 772 pledged delegates and 472 superdelegates). Sanders has 574 delegates (including 551 pledged delegates and 23 superdelegates). Superdelegates are party officials and lawmakers who can vote at the convention and have already made their intentions clear.

9485.0,Memo to the Next Administration: Defense Spending Must Be For Actual Defense,"Written by Ron Paul Sunday November 13, 2016 In a disturbing indication of how difficult it would be to bring military spending in line with actual threats overseas, House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry (R – TX) told President Obama last week that his war funding request of $11.6 billion for the rest of the year was far too low. That figure for the last two months of 2016 is larger than Spain’s budget for the entire year! And this is just a “war-fighting” supplemental, not actual “defense” spending! More US troops are being sent to Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere and the supplemental request is a way to pay for them without falling afoul of the “sequestration” limits.The question is whether this increase in US military activity and spending overseas actually keeps us safer, or whether it simply keeps the deep state and the military-industrial complex alive and well-funded.Unfortunately many Americans confuse defense spending with military spending. The two terms are used almost interchangeably. But there is a huge difference. I have always said that I wouldn’t cut anything from the defense budget. We need a robust defense of the United States and it would be foolish to believe that we have no enemies or potential enemies.The military budget is something very different from the defense budget. The military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the United States, but to enrich the military-industrial complex, benefit special interests, regime-change countries overseas, maintain a global US military empire, and provide defense to favored allies. The military budget for the United States is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line.To get the military budget in line with our real defense needs would require a focus on our actual interests and a dramatic decrease in spending. The spending follows the policy, and the policy right now reflects the neocon and media propaganda that we must run the rest of the world or there will be total chaos. This is sometimes called “American exceptionalism,” but it is far from a “pro-American” approach.Do we really need to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars manipulating elections overseas? Destabilizing governments that do not do as Washington tells them? Rewarding those who follow Washington’s orders with massive aid and weapons sales? Do we need to continue the endless war in Afghanistan even as we discover that Saudi Arabia had far more to do with 9/11 than the Taliban we have been fighting for a decade and a half? Do we really need 800 US military bases in more than 70 countries overseas? Do we need to continue to serve as the military protection force for our wealthy NATO partners even though they are more than capable of defending themselves? Do we need our CIA to continue to provoke revolutions like in Ukraine or armed insurgencies like in Syria?If the answer to these questions is “yes,” then I am afraid we should prepare for economic collapse in very short order. Then, with our economy in ruins, we will face the wrath of those countries overseas which have been in the crosshairs of our interventionist foreign policy. If the answer is no, then we must work to convince our countrymen to reject the idea of Empire and embrace the United States as a constitutional republic that no longer goes abroad seeking monsters to slay.

4701.0,"In New Responses, Hillary Clinton Insists Email Setup A Matter Of 'Convenience'","In New Responses, Hillary Clinton Insists Email Setup A Matter Of 'Convenience'

Hillary Clinton said she decided to employ a private email server ""for the purpose of convenience"" in early 2009 and doesn't remember ""specific consultations"" about using that account to conduct State Department business, the Democratic presidential nominee told lawyers in material related to a Freedom of Information Act case released Thursday.

In written responses to 25 questions from the conservative group Judicial Watch, Clinton largely hewed to her prior statements about the email controversy, often saying she did not recall details about the arrangement. Clinton signed the court filing ""under penalty of perjury"" on October 10, one day after her debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have tangled with Judicial Watch for more than 20 years.

Some of that friction showed in her answers over 20-odd pages, littered with objections. At times, the candidate accused the conservative nonprofit of misstating her earlier remarks.

On occasion, she declined to answer questions about the vulnerability of her emails to hacking on the ground that it exceeded the boundaries of what a judge ordered earlier this year. And she cited attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer a question about her 11-hour testimony to a congressional panel in October 2015 that 90 to 95 percent of her emails ""were in the State's system.""

The Justice Department closed an investigation into Clinton's email practices with no charges against her or any of her aides. FBI Director James Comey found she had been ""extremely careless"" but concluded ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would have sought criminal charges. But that decision remains deeply unpopular among Republicans in Congress and with Trump, who is vying with Clinton to become president.

In the course of the investigation, the FBI recovered thousands of Clinton's emails during her tenure at the State Department. Many of those messages will be released in batches over the next month.

Clinton has said using one email account was a ""mistake"" she will not repeat. But it is also one she is unlikely to shake for the time being, if conservative watchdogs get their way.

""We're pleased that we now have a little bit more information about Hillary Clinton's email practices,"" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said. ""Our lawyers will be reviewing the responses closely. Mrs. Clinton's refusal to answer many of the questions in a clear and straightforward manner further reflects disdain for the rule of law.""",REAL,in new responses hillary clinton insists email setup

4929.0,Trump mulls alternative options for making Mexico finance 'the wall',"While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don’t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.

LifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a “joint border security fund” -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border – for border construction and maintenance.

Trump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.

“There are many ways that they can pay for the wall,” Trump said, calling it a “negotiation.”

But he again insisted, “The United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.”

Breitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump’s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.

Trump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.

Speaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used – though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.

“Recognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,” Carson said. “That money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That’s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.”

Trump has not addressed such details on the stump.

He declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, “Mexico will pay for the wall … they don’t know it yet, but they’re going to pay.”

That came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn’t discuss “payment,” while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.

According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto’s claims.

If a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.

Estimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.",REAL,while donald trump doubled down this week on his vow to make mexico pay for

6698.0,The circus of liars - America's three rings of evil clowns,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:19 UTC © Jen Psaki President Obama holds news conference at the White House. As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the ""click"" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. ""P.J."" Crowley made his ""deal with the devil"" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; ""Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?"" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. ""Fuck the EU"", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the ""WOW"" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as ""hash tag diplimacy."" Her ""hot mic"" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being ""ridiculous"", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd ""fix"" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the ""Kirbys"" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's ""Russians in body bags"" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline ""U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy"", it did not originate with them. Our new ""probably"" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Turman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the ""Man"" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The ""Man"" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.",FAKE,wed  oct   utc  jen psaki president obama holds news conference at the white house as an american someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail i am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my countrys government the level and scope of the deceit with which the obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing for the first time in my  years i realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as american our leaders have shamed us done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people and still most of my countrymen sit idle america today reminds me of a traveling circus three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers or are we participant clowns for over the better part of barack obamas presidency weve witnessed the most respected nation transformed stepbystep into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known  million people all their ancestors and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of obamas mistakes and malfeasance in office while i do not personally believe this man is evil i am sure the people behind him are the lies the impact the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity i wonder as i type this how many people reading it will realize how true my words are john kirby the spokesperson for the us department of state is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation he is a mirror reflection of secretary of state john kerry who is in turn a further reflection of barack obama and the people who stand behind they lie cheat steal kill maim or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency the people have no inkling of all of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today this press conference on the alleged bombing of aleppo hospitals by russia it is damning damnable evidence of what i am saying this is of course if one watches intently and then reasons compare what kirby says with what you have seen or read from the wall street journal or the new york times measure the tone and content of this unique message bear with me and ill help you convict these warmongers of their crimes the circus of liars i must

667.0,"Donald Trump said ‘university’ was all about education. Actually, its goal was: ‘Sell, sell, sell!’","When Donald Trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower, he declared that it would be unlike any of his other ventures.

Trump University would be a noble endeavor, he said, with an emphasis on education over profits. It was a way for him to give back, to share his expertise with the masses, to build a “legacy as an educator.”

He wouldn’t even keep all the money — if he happened to make a profit, he would turn the funds over to charity.

“If I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge, I think I’d be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money,” Trump said at the inaugural news conference in the spring of 2005.

The launch of Trump University coincided with two auspicious developments for the real estate mogul: Through his then-year-old hit TV show “The Apprentice,” the billionaire was developing an image as America’s savviest boss, while the nation’s booming real estate market was giving hope to many who dreamed of striking it rich.

Ads touted Trump University as “the next best thing to being Trump’s apprentice.” Trump, who every week on TV singled out someone to be fired, pledged in a promotional video to “hand-pick” instructors. “Priceless information” would help attendees build wealth in the same real estate game that made Trump rich.

In the end, few if any of these statements would prove to be true.

Trump University was not a university. It was not even a school. Rather, it was a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country that promised attendees they could get rich quick but were mostly devoted to enriching the people who ran them.

Participants were enticed with local newspaper ads featuring images of Trump, then encouraged to write checks or charge tens of thousands of dollars on credit cards for multi-day learning sessions. Participants were considered “buyers,” as one internal document put it. According to the company’s former president, Trump did not personally pick the instructors. Many attendees were trained by people with little or no real estate expertise, customers and former employees have alleged in lawsuits against the company.

“I was told to do one thing,” said James Harris, a Trump University instructor whose sessions have been repeatedly cited in the litigation, in an interview with The Washington Post. “And that one thing was: . . . to show up to teach, train and motivate people to purchase the Trump University products and services and make sure everybody bought. That is it.”

A Trump spokesman said Harris’s comments “have no merit” and accused Harris of “looking for media attention to further his own agenda.”

All told, Trump University received about $40 million in revenue from more than 5,000 participants before it halted operations in 2010 amid lawsuits in New York and California alleging widespread fraud. The New York attorney general estimated Trump netted more than $5 million during the five years it was active. He has since acknowledged that he gave none of the profits to charity.

This account is based on a review of hundreds of pages of internal company records that have become public as a result of the lawsuits, as well as new interviews with former Trump University employees and customers.

Many of the company’s internal records, including several “playbooks” that advised employees on strategies for pressuring customers, were unsealed in court over the past week in response to a request by The Post.

Trump and his lawyers have vigorously disputed the allegations, predicting that they will win in court and reopen the business. They point to positive customer-satisfaction surveys that have been submitted in the lawsuits and suggest they have been unfairly targeted by trial lawyers and a politically motivated attorney general in New York.

“We continue to believe that people got substantial value and that people were overwhelmingly satisfied,” said Trump’s general counsel, Alan Garten. “We are not going to be stopping what we are doing. We are going to continue to zealously defend this case because, at the end of the day, we know we are not being tried by The Washington Post or by CNN — but in a courtroom by a jury.”

Garten acknowledged that Trump never gave away the profits to charity. He said it was always Trump’s intention but that the lawyers leading the class-action suits against the company “got a hold of this and . . . whatever profits existed sort of evaporated.” The unfulfilled promise was first reported last year by Time magazine.

In his defense, Trump has often cited the many positive reviews by former customers. A number of them submitted sworn statements in court explaining their positive experiences at Trump University.

Kissy and Mark Gordon, who own a residential development company in Virginia and jointly signed up for the most expensive program in 2008, said in an interview that they still use techniques they learned from the course today.

“Did we have an expectation that Trump was going to teach us? No,” Kissy Gordon said. “We have a building background and the economy changed, and we were looking for something in the same field to do something with it. So we were there to learn.”

Gregory Leishman, another former customer, recalled speaking to his assigned Trump University mentor on the phone weekly and touring potential properties for purchase with him in New Haven, Conn. “They gave me information I didn’t have otherwise,” he said. “You can probably get all that information from reading books. But Trump University was a crash course. You pay more, you get more.”

Nonetheless, the company has emerged as one of the most potent lines of attack against Trump’s campaign for president.

In the Republican primary, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) cited it as a “fake university” and sought to use it to help build a case that Trump was a “con artist.”

In recent days, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her campaign have picked up on that theme.

“Trump U is devastating because its a metaphor for his whole campaign: promising hardworking Americans a way to get ahead, but all based on lies,” tweeted press secretary Brian Fallon.

Trump also last week invited a torrent of criticism, including from legal scholars on the left and right, for accusing the judge presiding over the California suits, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased because he is of Mexican descent. Trump has said that Curiel is “Mexican,” although the 62-year-old was born in Indiana, and that because Trump wants to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border the judge cannot properly do his job.

The focus on Trump University also reignited a controversy in Texas over the decision there by the state attorney general not to file a fraud case against the business. Newly disclosed documents reported by Texas media show that investigators had probed the company for seven months and recommended a lawsuit. The inquiry was shut down when Trump University closed up shop in the state.

Trump later gave $35,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of then-Attorney General Greg Abbott. A spokesman for Abbott, now the Republican governor of Texas, has said it’s “absurd” to suggest a connection between the case and the donation that came several years later and that Trump University was “forced out of Texas and consumers were protected.”

Garten also dismissed any connection between the Texas decision and Trump’s donation, saying investigators reviewed “a few complaints . . . and decided not to proceed.”

The Trump University sales pitch began at free seminars, such as one hosted at a Holiday Inn just outside of Washington in 2009.

[In downturn, aspiring moguls turn to Trump U. for wisdom]

A placard outside the ballroom read, “Trump, think BIG.” Inside, aspiring real estate investors heard the theme song from “The Apprentice,” the O’Jays classic, “For the Love of Money.”

Then, a Trump University instructor took the microphone. “All right, you guys ready to be the next Trump real estate millionaire? Yes or No!?” he yelled, according to a Post account at the time.

The purpose of these free 90-minute introductions was not to turn attendees into millionaires, but rather to “set the hook” for future sales, according to employee playbooks.

The playbooks directed leaders of the free seminars to conclude introductory events by getting “in the sales mindset,” “ready to sell, sell, sell!”

Three-day courses typically cost $1,495, the records show. But people who paid to attend them were then urged to sign up for even pricier “elite” programs.

A “workshop enrollment form” distributed to participants laid out the options in categories, starting with the “Trump Gold Elite” program. At $34,995, it was the most expensive option — providing three days of personal, in-the-field mentorship as well as special programs on real estate investment, “wealth preservation” and “creative financing.”

The “Trump Silver Elite” package, priced at $19,495, offered real estate and finance training. The “Trump Bronze Elite,” priced at $9,995, offered similar, but fewer, courses.

Employees distributed “profile” surveys on the first day of the seminars, in which participants would outline their financial goals, as well as current assets and liabilities. Attendees were told that the information would help them figure out how much they had to invest in real estate, according to customer complaints.

But in the evenings, after seminars had concluded for the first day, staff members were instructed to use the information to rank each participant according to assets they had available to spend on more Trump University programs.

“If they can afford the gold elite,” the playbook advised, “don’t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite.”

A 43-page “sales playbook” offered guidance on using psychological tools to convince students that they needed to sign up for the classes to fulfill their own goals — overcoming their worries that they might not need or be able to afford the classes.

“Customers don’t have needs — they have problems,” the book advised. “Problems are like health. The more a problem hurts now, the more the need for a solution now. And the more it hurts, the more they’ll be prepared to pay for a speedy solution.”

In a section devoted to “negotiating student resistance,” sales people were offered sample responses to common objections from potential students. If a potential customer said he was concerned about going into debt to pay for the classes, staff were advised to needle them: “I see, do you like living paycheck to paycheck?”

If doubts persisted, staffers were advised to invoke the big boss himself.

“Mr. Trump won’t listen to excuses and neither will we,” the instructors were told to say.

Former students have said they were instructed to call their credit card companies on the spot and raise their borrowing limit to pay for the program.

Harris, the former instructor, recalled one of his typical pitches to urge customers to find money for programs: “Do you have any equity on your home? Do you have a 401(k) or IRA?”

Harris, 47, said he was one of Trump University’s biggest sellers. Garten, Trump’s lawyer, said Harris was one of the most highly rated instructors.

Instructors had to sell hard to turn participants at free seminars into paying customers.

For the four years Trump University operated, more than 80,300 people attended the free introductory sessions. Those previews were offered 2,000 times in nearly 700 locations around the country.

But only around 6,000 people paid between $995 and $1,995 to attend three-day seminars, director of operations Mark Covais said in a 2012 affidavit. According to Covais, 572 people paid the full $34,995 for the top-level Trump University mentorship.

The entire program was built around Trump — his picture, his quotes and the promise of obtaining access to his special formula for prosperity.

One ad for the free Trump University seminars that appeared in a Corpus Christi, Tex., newspaper in 2009 promised attendees that they would “Learn from the Master,” below a picture of Trump.

“I can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor,” read a quote on the ad, attributed to Trump.

The California class-action lawsuit contains 49 separate instances of Trump University attendees being told their instructor or future mentor was personally chosen by Trump in 2009 alone.

“Donald Trump personally picked me,” one instructor told a group at a free seminar in May 2009, according to a transcript of the session filed as part of the New York case. “He could have picked anybody in this world but he picked me and the reason he picked me is because I’ve been very, very successful helping average people make a lot of money.”

Harris, the former instructor, told an introductory meeting of potential customers in 2009 that Trump’s personal generosity was a core element of the program.

“He did not have to start this university,” Harris told the group, according to a transcript in the New York case. “He does not need the money. . . . He does not get a dime of it. Does everyone understand this? Please say ‘yes.’ He does not need the money.”

In one presentation cited in the New York lawsuit, Harris described Trump as instrumental to his own efforts to turn his life around just after high school.

“I lived on the streets of New York, mostly down in the subways for the first nine months, and I did a lot of things to make some money,” he told a group attending a 2008 event. “And then I met a gentleman and he took me in, and I lived with him for a year and he taught me how to do real estate. He is still my mentor today. So the reason I am here is because Donald Trump picked me.”

In an interview, Harris said he met Trump once in the early 1990s, backstage at an event at the Taj Mahal casino. “Here is the truth,” he said. “When I was at Trump University, I had not one interaction with him ever. Not one.”

In reality, the instructors were not close to Trump, and many were not experts in real estate, according to several ex-staffers who have testified in the lawsuits.

“The Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke,” said Jason Nicholas, who worked for the company for seven months in 2007 and submitted a statement in the lawsuit. “In my opinion, it was just selling false hopes and lies.”

Michael Sexton, who was president of Trump University, acknowledged in sworn testimony in the New York case that none of the event instructors were hand-picked by Trump. Trump told lawyers in California that he would not dispute Sexton’s statement — nor could he remember a series of instructors, including Harris, by name or face.

Trump also did not review course curriculum, Sexton said.

“He would never do that,” Sexton said. “Mr. Trump is not going to go through a 300-page, you know, binder of content.”

Only when it came to marketing material was Trump deeply involved, reviewing every piece of advertisement, Sexton testified.

“Mr. Trump understandably is protective of his brand and very protective of his image and how he’s portrayed,” Sexton said. “And he wanted to see how his brand and image were portrayed in Trump University marketing materials. And he had very good and substantive input as well.”

Garten, the Trump attorney, said Trump was engaged as any CEO would be in the operations. Outside experts designed the curriculum, Garten said, but Trump was “intimately involved” in the process. While Trump may not have selected every instructor, Garten said he was “very much involved in the process and the discussion of what type of instructor was desired.”

At the courses, students were supposed to learn Trump’s secrets of real estate success.

But in sworn testimony in New York, Sexton could recall only one Trump practice that was incorporated into the courses: Invest in foreclosed properties.

The lesson underscored how Trump University, which was formed to teach aspiring business people to profit from the fast-expanding housing market, tailored itself after the 2008 economic crash to offer guidance on profiting from the aftermath.

One ad placed in the San Antonio Express-News in October 2009 promised that seminars would allow participants to “learn from Donald Trump’s handpicked experts how you can profit from the largest real estate liquidation in history.”

At a seminar called “Fast Track to Foreclosure,” students were instructed to find OPM, “other people’s money,” to buy homes out of foreclosure at depressed prices, dress them up with new paint and attractive landscaping — then flip them for profit.

Attendees were advised to use credit cards to invest in real estate, and they were told how to persuade credit card companies to raise their credit limits. If a credit card company representative asked for their income, they were advised to add $75,000 in anticipated earnings from their real estate venture before providing a figure for their expected earnings for the year.

Some customers have also alleged they were told there would be a personal appearance at the session by Trump. Instead, they received the opportunity to get their photograph taken with a life-size cardboard cutout of the mogul.

John Brown, a customer who provided a sworn statement in the New York case, described how he “came to realize that I was not adequately trained, which caused me to feel that Trump University had taken advantage of me.”

Brown said he paid $1,495 for a three-day seminar in 2009 and then used multiple credit cards to charge a $24,995 Trump mentorship program. Three years later, he said he had made no real estate investments using Trump knowledge — but was still paying off $20,000 from the courses.

“Because of the Trump name,” he said, “I felt these classes would be the best.”",REAL,when donald trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower he declared that it would be

8516.0,Trump Has Forever Changed American Politics,"Trump Has Forever Changed American Politics > November 7, 2016, 9:46 pm A+ | a- Warning   
“If I don’t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime,” says Donald Trump. 
Herewith, a dissent. Whatever happens Tuesday, Trump has made history and has forever changed American politics. 
Though a novice in politics, he captured the Party of Lincoln with the largest turnout of primary voters ever, and he has inflicted wounds on the nation’s ruling class from which it may not soon recover. 
Bush I and II, Mitt Romney , the neocons and the GOP commentariat all denounced Trump as morally and temperamentally unfit. Yet, seven of eight Republicans are voting for Trump, and he drew the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of any GOP nominee. 
Not only did he rout the Republican elites, he ash-canned their agenda and repudiated the wars into which they plunged the country. 
Trump did not create the forces that propelled his candidacy. But he recognized them, tapped into them, and unleashed a gusher of nationalism and populism that will not soon dissipate. 
Whatever happens Tuesday, there is no going back now. 
How could the Republican establishment advance anew the trade and immigration policies that their base has so thunderously rejected? 
How can the GOP establishment credibly claim to speak for a party that spent the last year cheering a candidate who repudiated the last two Republican presidents and the last two Republican nominees? 
Do mainstream Republicans think that should Trump lose a Bush Restoration lies ahead? The dynasty is as dead as the Romanovs . 
The media, whose reputation has sunk to Congressional depths, has also suffered a blow to its credibility. 
Its hatred of Trump has been almost manic, and WikiLeaks revelations of the collusion between major media and Clintonites have convinced skeptics that the system is rigged and the referees of democracy are in the tank. 
But it is the national establishment that has suffered most. 
The Trump candidacy exposed what seems an unbridgeable gulf between this political class and the nation in whose name it purports to speak. 
Consider the litany of horrors it has charged Trump with. 
He said John McCain was no hero, that some Mexican illegals are “ rapists .” He mocked a handicapped reporter. He called some women “pigs.” He wants a temporary ban to Muslim immigration. He fought with a Gold Star mother and father. He once engaged in “ fat-shaming ” a Miss Universe, calling her “Miss Piggy, ” and telling her to stay out of Burger King. He allegedly made crude advances on a dozen women and starred in the “Access Hollywood” tape with Billy Bush. 
While such “gaffes” are normally fatal for candidates, Trump’s followers stood by him through them all. 
Why? asks an alarmed establishment. Why, in spite of all this, did Trump’s support endure? Why did the American people not react as they once would have? Why do these accusations not have the bite they once did? 
Answer. We are another country now, an us-or-them country. 
Middle America believes the establishment is not looking out for the nation but for retention of its power. And in attacking Trump it is not upholding some objective moral standard but seeking to destroy a leader who represents a grave threat to that power. 
Trump’s followers see an American Spring as crucial, and they are not going to let past boorish behavior cause them to abandon the last best chance to preserve the country they grew up in. 
These are the Middle American Radicals, the MARs of whom my late friend Sam Francis wrote. 
They recoil from the future the elites have mapped out for them and, realizing the stakes, will overlook the faults and failings of a candidate who holds out the real promise of avoiding that future. 
They believe Trump alone will secure the borders and rid us of a trade regime that has led to the loss of 70,000 factories and 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. They believe Trump is the best hope for keeping us out of the wars the Beltway think tanks are already planning for the sons of the “deplorables” to fight. 
Moreover, they see the establishment as the quintessence of hypocrisy. Trump is instructed to stop using such toxic phrases as “America First” and “Make America Great Again” by elites who think 55 million abortions since Roe is a milestone of moral progress. 
And what do they have in common with a woman who thinks partial-birth abortion, which her predecessor in the Senate, Pat Moynihan, called “ infanticide ,” is among the cherished “reproductive rights” of women? 
While a Trump victory would create the possibility of a coalition of conservatives, populists, patriots and nationalists governing America, should he lose, America’s future appears disunited and grim. 
But, would the followers of Donald Trump, whom Hillary Clinton has called “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic … bigots,” to the cheers of her media retainers, unite behind her should she win? 
No. Win or lose, as Sen. Edward Kennedy said at the Democratic Convention of 1980, “The work goes on, the cause endures.”",FAKE,trump has forever changed american politics  november    pm a  a warning if i dont win this will

10048.0,"The role of the US and Nato in EU relations with China, by Manlio Dinucci","The role of the US and Nato in EU relations with China by Manlio Dinucci Participating in an international conference, the Italian geographer Manlio Dinucci ties together the various strands of his analysis of the weapons that the US has at its disposal to dominate the entire world. Yet the importance of this article goes beyond that. For it is on account of this domination, this unipolar global order, that Syria, Russia and China, challenge today the use of force.
Voltaire Network | Rome (Italy) | 28 October 2016 français Español I will get straight to the heart of the issue. I do not think it possible to speak of relations between the European Union (the EU) and China independently of the influence the United States wields over the EU directly and [indirectly], through Nato.
Today 22 of the 28 (27 once Great Britain has left the EU), EU member states with more than 90% of the EU population, are members of Nato, recognized as the “foundation for collective defence”. And Nato is under US command: the US Supreme Allied Command in Europe is always appointed by the US President and all the other key commands are in the US’s hands. Accordingly, the EU’s foreign and military policy is fundamentally subordinated to the US strategy to which the major European powers have aligned themselves.
Such a strategy, clearly announced in official documents, is sketched out at that moment in history when, following the dissolution of the URSS, the world situation changes. In 1991, the White House declares in the National Security Strategy of the United States :
“The United States remains the only State with the force, capability and influence in every dimension – political, economic and military – that is effectively global. Nothing can substitute for US leadership”.
In 1992, in the Defense Planning Guidance , the Pentagon emphasizes:
“Our primary objective is to prevent any hostile power dominating a region whose resources would be sufficient to generate a global power. These regions include Western Europe, Eastern Asia, the territory of the former Soviet Union and South-West Asia”.
In 2001, in the report Quadrennial Defense Review – published a week before the US/Nato war in Afghanistan, an area of primary geostrategic importance in relation to Russia and China - the Pentagon announces:
“It is possible that a military rival may emerge in Asia with a formidable resource base. US armed forces must maintain their capabilities to impose the US’s will on any adversary, so as to change the regime of an enemy state or to occupy a foreign territory so that US strategic objectives can be realized”.
On the basis of this strategy, US-led Nato, has launched an offensive on the Eastern front: after demolishing by war the Federation of Yugoslavia, from 1999 to date, it has subsumed all the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, three of the former Yugoslavia, three of the former URSS and very soon will incorporate others (starting from Georgia and Ukraine – the latter a de facto Nato member), moving bases and forces, nuclear included, ever closer to the Russian borders.
At the same time, on the Southern front, closely connected to the Eastern front, the war waged by the US-led Nato has demolished the Libyan State and has tried to do the same thing with the Syrian State.
USA and Nato have tried to make the Ukraine crisis explode and, accusing Russia of “destabilizing European security”, have dragged Europe into a new Cold War, intended particularly by Washington (at the cost of European economies damaged by sanctions and counter-sanctions) to fracture EU–Russian political and economic relations damaged by US interests. This same strategy also includes an increasing deployment of US military forces in the Asia/Pacific region for anti-Chinese reasons. The U.S. Navy has announced that in 2020 it will concentrate 60% of its naval and air forces in this region.
The US strategy is focused on the South China Sea and Admiral Harris, head of the US Command for the Pacific, emphasizes the importance of this: through this sea passes maritime trade with an annual value of more than 5,000 billion dollars, including 25% from global export of oil and 50% of natural gas. The US wants to control these routes in the name of which Admiral Harris defines “the freedom of navigation fundamental for our way of life here in the US”, accusing China, in his very words of “aggressive actions in the South China Sea, similar to Russian action in the Crimea”. For this, the US Navy “is patrolling” the South China Sea. Riding on the back of the US, the biggest European powers arrive: last July, France has requested the European Union to “coordinate the naval surveillance of the South China Sea to ensure a regular and visible presence in these waters over which China has illegally asserted title”. And while the US established in South Korea anti-missile systems which are also capable of launching nuclear missiles, similar to those installed against Russia in Romania and very shortly in Poland, as well as on board the war ships in the Mediterranean, on 6 October, the Nato Secretary General Stoltenberg receives South Korea’s Minister for Foreign Affairs at Brussels, to “strengthen Nato’s partnership with Seoul”.
These and other facts demonstrate that the same strategy is implemented in Europe and Asia. It is the extreme attempt of the United States and other Western Powers to maintain their economic, political and military supremacy in a world, radically transformed, where new states and social subjects are emerging. The Shanghai Organization for Co-operation, born out of a strategic Chinese-Russian agreement, provides resources and working capacities, making it the biggest integrated economic area in the world. The Shanghai and BRICS organizations are capable, with their financial organizations, of largely displacing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that, for more than 70 years, have allowed the USA and major western powers to dominate the global economy through loans that fetter the economic sovereignty of indebted countries and other financial instruments. The new organizations can, at the same time, achieve a de-dollarization of their trade agreements, depriving the US of its capacity to off-load its debt on the other countries, by printing dollar notes used as the dominant international currency.
To maintain its supremacy, increasingly wavering, the US relies not only on the strength of its weapons, but also weapons more efficient than “weapons” in the strict sense of the word.
The first weapon: the so-called “Free Trade Agreements” such as the “Transatlantic Partnership on Trade and Investment” (TTIP) between the USA and the EU and the “Transpacific Partnership” (TPP), both of which have economic, geopolitical and geostrategic objectives. This is why, Hillary Clinton defines the EU-US partnership “the biggest strategic aim of our transatlantic alliance”, proposing an “Economic Nato” that integrates that the political with the military. The plan is clear: to form a political, economic and military US-EU block, increasingly under US command which acts as a countervailing force to the following:
• the Eurasiatic area, now on the rise and based on cooperation between China and Russia;
• the Brics; and
• Iran and any other country that manages to escape Western domination.
The TTIP negotiations are struggling to make headway due to a conflict of interests and vast opposition in Europe. But that obstacle is now circumvented through the “Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement” (CETA) between Canada and the EU: a TTIP in disguise, given that Canada is already party to NAFTA which also binds the USA. The EU will probably sign off CETA when the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau visits Brussels this 27 October.
The second weapon: penetrating the target countries from within. Leverage is drawn from the weak points that each country has to varying extents: corruption, a greed for money, political ascent, secessionary movements fed by local power groups, religious fanaticism, the vulnerability of the great masses for political demagogy. Playing as well, in certain cases, on a justified popular dissatisfaction with the actions of their own government. The instruments used to penetrate? The so-called “non-governmental organizations”. These are, in actual fact, the long hand of the Department of State and the CIA. These NGOs, endowed with deep pools of financial resources, have organized the Eastern European “colour revolutions” and replicated the same operation with the so-called “Umbrella Revolution” in Hong Kong, aiming at developing similar movements in other parts of China where the national minorities live. The same organizations operate in Latin America, with the primary objective of subverting Brazil’s democratic institutions, thereby threatening Brics from within. Instruments to achieve the strategy are terrorist groups, such as those armed and infiltrated in Libya and Syria to sow seeds of chaos, contributing to destruction of whole States attacked at the same time from outside.
The third arm: “Psyops” (Psychological operations), launched through the global media chains, defined as follows by the Pentagon: “Planned Operations to influence, through specific information, the emotions and mindset, and thus the conduct of public opinion, organizations and foreign governments, so as to induce or strengthen conduct favourable to pre-established objectives”.
Such operations, prepare public opinion for warlike escalation and create the impression that Russia is responsible for tensions in Europe just as China is for the tensions in Asia, as well as accusing them at the same time of “violating human rights”.
1965: Manlio Dinucci, and his wife, Carla, before the ancestral home of Mao Tse Toung. A final consideration: during the sixties, my wife and I worked in Peking, contributing, inter alia, to the publication of the first Chinese journal in the Italian language. I experienced a life-changing learning experience when China – liberated from the colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal conditions for at least 15 years – was completely isolated. Neither the West nor the United Nations recognized it as a sovereign state. This period imprinted on my mind, the ability of the Chinese people (at the time totalling 600 million), to resist, their consciousness and commitment under the guide of the Communist party to constructing a society with a brand new economic and cultural foundation. I think that this capacity is today still needed so that today’s China, that is developing its enormous potential, can resist new plans for imperial domination and contribute to the decisive struggle for the future of humanity: a world free of wars; where peace, inextricably linked to social justice, prevails.

5199.0,The Daily 202: Many African Americans unenthusiastically ‘settle’ for Hillary Clinton,"RALEIGH, N.C.—Ayana McAllister went to Hillary Clinton’s rally two weekends ago at St. Augustine’s University, the historically-black school where she’s a freshman. She watched the Democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland. But on the eve of the election, the 18-year-old is still not 100 percent sold.

“I don’t know,” said McAllister, a native of Largo, Md. “I feel like I’ve got to settle for Hillary. I feel like I’m going to vote because I know I need to, not because I want to. I feel like neither of them should be president, but I feel like Hillary will be better. Really, it’s like two children arguing back and forth.”

This was a common refrain during interviews at yesterday’s football game here between St. Augustine and crosstown rival Shaw University, another historically-black institution.

-- Early voting numbers and polling suggest that African American turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008. Though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days, alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the Clinton high command.

-- Many students at the schools here in Raleigh regret that they never got to vote for Barack Obama. They are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between Clinton and Donald Trump, but they plan to vote nonetheless. In fact, teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on Tuesday.

“I am not a fan of either one, but of the two I will probably be voting for Hillary,” said Anoviua Rush, a freshman from Durham. “She’s just a liar. And Hillary is not even good at backing up her lies. Everyone makes mistakes, but when you try to cover them up it’s a problem.”

As a marching band performed behind her, under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day, Rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her, but Clinton’s support for equal pay legislation does. “She’s more understanding of minorities and what we go through,” said Rush. “I’m not going to say he’s ‘racist,’ but he’s said some messed up stuff about minorities. … Donald’s main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and, I’ll say it, possibly Caucasians.”

-- “A lot of people are very discouraged. Very, very discouraged,” said Felishia McPherson, 47, who was wearing a “Black Lives Matter” t-shirt. “Really, it’s like you’re choosing between a liar and a clown. But who doesn’t lie? We all lie. … I’m a mental health counselor. I know that, psychologically, in order to want to be president, you’ve got to be a little narcissistic to start with. … Trump was never an option for me. I don’t love Hillary, but I don’t have to. She’s not coming to my house. She’s going to the White House.”

McPherson already voted early for Clinton. She brought her seven-year-old niece Malia, named after the president’s daughter, to Obama’s rally in Fayetteville on Friday. “I don’t know if I actually believe in the political system, as far as does my one vote count? But I’m not going to take a chance of it not counting,” she explained afterward. “If the system really does work, then I’m going to participate. If it doesn’t, then I still did the best I could by my ancestors. … I do believe, with Obama’s encouragement, even though we may not believe in the system, we know we need to do it.”

-- Several elderly African Americans expressed deep concern that millennials, including their grandchildren, do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting. Irene Hill-Thomas, 79, is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in Sampson County. “If you’ve been around long enough, your eyes are open,” she said. “You appreciate it because you fought for it. The younger generation hasn’t been there. They don’t know. The younger generation doesn’t understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so. … I remember the white and the colored fountains. They don’t.”

-- North Carolina was the closest state Obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012. African Americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times, and Obama won almost all of them.

Reflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in North Carolina, and the strategic significance of the Research Triangle specifically, both candidates will return to Raleigh on Monday. Trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds, and Clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here -- at midnight.

-- Another very important explanation for why African American turnout is down in North Carolina: Republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours. The executive director of the state Republican Party persuaded GOP county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests. He pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open, especially evenings and Sundays, when many African Americans typically cast ballots (after church services).

In the Democratic-leaning county that includes Greensboro – the state’s third largest – there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open. This year there was just one. So while 61,000 people voted during the first week four years ago, only 8,000 did this year. (After that first week, 25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken.)

-- I shadowed a field staffer from the AFL-CIO affiliate group Working America as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of Raleigh yesterday afternoon. Walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Andrea Vogler urged folks to go vote.

During a period of just one hour, though, half a dozen African Americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long. So they came home. They all said they hope to still go on Tuesday, but what if the lines are long then too? Will they stick around?

A woman in a nurse’s uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week, but the lines were too long each time.

A younger man named Victor came to his door in red-checkered pajamas. He had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around. He works a night shift, so he said he’s going to try voting on his drive home from work at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday – which he hopes will be before a crowd forms.

“I’ve heard that on a couple of different days now,” Vogler, 32, lamented as she walked to the next house. “On the one hand, it is good people are trying to vote. On the other, I hope it doesn’t deter anyone from actually voting.”

A woman named Barbara, pulling out of her driveway in a Chevy Trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat, is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines.

Damien, her husband, was who Vogler had come to talk with. Barbara warned her that he was sleeping. But every vote counts, so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway. He was nonplussed. “I worked all damn night, 12 hours,” he said, his eyes bloodshot. “I just want to go back to my bed.” She tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for Clinton. He grimaced and refused to take it.

Working America has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states. They have had 573,400 conversations with voters since launching this summer, including 45,500 in North Carolina. In the Raleigh area alone, the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on Saturday. The group largely targets African American and Latino voters, though some swing white Republicans are in their universe.

An older man sitting in his green Chevy Lumina, picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of ground-level studio apartments, told Vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon. She informed him that early voting had ended for the day, and that Saturday was the final opportunity until Tuesday. “Damn,” he replied.

“North Carolina is the most important state,” Vogler stressed over and over again. “You’ve got to get out to vote!”

-- In an interview late last night, I asked Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross – who is in a neck-and-neck race with Sen. Richard Burr that may decide which party controls the majority – about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines. “It’s by design,” she complained. But she argued that this will also galvanize many African Americans on Tuesday. “I don’t think anything is going to keep people from voting this year,” she said.

Ross, a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for same-day voter registration (which was pivotal to Obama carrying the state a year later), noted that, for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites, many more waited around. “There were people who stood for hours in line,” she said.

The weather forecast for Tuesday looks good, and she believes this might make the difference in her “razor thin” race. “I think we’re going to see long lines on Election Day,” Ross predicted, with a southern twang. “We’re going to turn people out.”

A Clinton campaign official, speaking anonymously, said they were worried during the first week of early voting, but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout. But allies say Clinton may need to perform especially well on Election Day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks.

Surrogates have also streamed into the state to drive African Americans to the polls. Civil rights icon John Lewis headlined a march in Charlotte on Thursday. Cory Booker came Friday night. Other efforts are underway too. The national president of the Sierra Club was outside the St. Augustine’s football game handing out biscuits from Bojangles’ and urging young people to support Clinton in order to advance environmental issues.

-- The president himself has now spoken at five rallies for Clinton in North Carolina. Addressing a crowd of 2,500 that was probably 95 percent black in Fayetteville on Friday, he made a very explicit pitch. “Right now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor ‘certain areas’ on Election Day,” Obama said. “I don’t know what ‘certain areas’ he’s talking about, but you do.”

He finished his speech with the story of a 100-year-old woman who was purged from the North Carolina voter rolls after a Republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds. Grace Bell Hardison was mentioned in an NAACP lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on Friday. North Carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters – most black and Democratic -- who had been cut from the rolls under a so-called “individual challenge law.”

“So, young people, I want you to understand this,” Obama said. “It wasn’t that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar (or) the number of bubbles on a bar of soap. It wasn’t that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi. … If you’ve been marching for criminal justice reform, that’s great. But you still need to vote! … If you vote, we’ll win North Carolina. And if we win North Carolina, Hillary Clinton will be president.”

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in Reno last night after a man reportedly yelled “gun,” but the GOP nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speech. Secret Service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weapon. The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was reportedly released after the event, telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a “Republicans against Trump” sign. “When I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,” Crites said. “And so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That’s what you would expect.” He said that the crowd tackled him, and began “kicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me.” (Jose A. DelReal, Anne Gearan and Ed O'Keefe have more.)

-- Donald Trump Jr. and top campaign social media aide Dan Scavino immediately retweeted unsubstantiated claims that Trump had just survived an attack on his life: “Hillary ran away from the rain today. Trump is back onstage minutes after assassination attempt,” the tweet read.

-- Meanwhile, a man wearing a mask and carrying a gun was arrested near the White House following a struggle with authorities. Immediate details surrounding the incident are unclear, but the Secret Service says he's being charged with carrying a firearm without a license, carrying unregistered ammunition, resisting arrest and committing a crime while wearing a mask. (Martin Weil)

-- A press bus following Tim Kaine in Tampa was hit “at high speed"" on Sunday evening, according to several people onboard. One reporter said the bus was hit by what appeared to be a police car. But there were no reports of injuries and the bus continued. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade.

-- Our WaPo/ABC News tracking poll finds Clinton leading Trump nationally by five points -- 48 percent to 43 percent -- widening last week’s tight race as she shows clear advantages on several personal attributes:

-- The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll finds Clinton up a similar four points (44-40). Clinton’s lead is less than half of the 11-point advantage she held in their mid-October survey, taken before the FBI email announcement. A wide swath of Trump’s support also comes from within his own party, as Republican voters rally around the nominee in the final stretch of the campaign.

-- A Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll shows Trump with a seven point lead in IOWA, up three points from last month.

-- A Columbus Dispatch poll shows Clinton eking out a single point lead over Trump in OHIO (48-47). Pollster Darrel Rowland says Clinton will “almost certainly” carry Ohio should enough young and minority voters show up to the polls. The same poll has Rob Portman crushing Ted Strickland by 21 points (58-37).LeBron James will appear alongside Clinton in Cleveland today on the final day of early in-person voting in OHIO.

-- The CBS News battleground tracker has Trump up 46-45 in OHIO and a 45-45 tie in FLORIDA.

THE FINAL SCHEDULES FOR BOTH CANDIDATES:

-- What's with the 11th-hour fluidity? Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz note that four states have dominated the Clinton campaign’s calculation throughout the fall: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. “Obama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton’s electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan (and) New Hampshire … to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. ... In Trump’s case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton’s, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers.” (The Post’s politics team lists the 15 states that will decide the election on Tuesday, breaking down the state of the race in each one.)

-- Why is Michigan getting so much late attention? Hillary campaigned in Detroit on Friday, and she’s coming back to Grand Rapids tomorrow while Barack Obama flies to Ann Arbor. Bill is stumping in Lansing at 1 p.m. today. Remember that HRC unexpectedly lost the state’s primary to Bernie Sanders in March, despite every poll putting her significantly ahead. Trump and Pence are also both going there. Fourteen percent of the electorate is African American.

-- The Clinton campaign is trying to downplay its late efforts in Michigan. “Look, if we hold onto Nevada (and) hold onto Michigan, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next President of the United States,” John Podesta said on Meet the Press this morning. “Most people vote on election day in Michigan, so our schedule has been oriented to being in the early vote states, in the earlier period of time.” Stephen Neuman, a senior adviser to the Democratic coordinated campaign in Michigan, noted that the campaign already has 35 offices. A Washington Post average of recent polls in the state has Clinton leading Trump in Michigan just 43 percent to 41 percent. Mook acknowledged that polls have has tightened in Michigan, but added: “I feel very confident about how we’re going to do.” (John Wagner and Anne Gearan)

-- Trump seems to have given up on Wisconsin. Aides told me last week that he’d probably go back multiple times, including to the Milwaukee suburbs. He’s not even going to come back once to the Badger State. But now he’s going to Minnesota (where he has absolutely not a snowball’s chance). The campaign said it has done polling there, but Maggie Haberman of the Times tweeted that this is a lie.

-- The latest indignity for the Speaker --> ""Trump cancels Wisconsin rally just as Paul Ryan says he would campaign with him,"" by Jessie Opoien in the Madison Capital Times: “For the second time in as many months, the possibility of a joint Paul Ryan-Donald Trump campaign appearance was floated and quickly yanked away. The Republican nominee earlier this week scheduled a Sunday afternoon rally in West Allis, just outside Milwaukee. It was to be Trump's sixth Wisconsin event since he lost the state's primary election. ‘We don't know if it's scheduled firm or not yet, but I intend to do it if he's here,’ Ryan told reporters Saturday when asked if he would attend the Trump rally. … ‘If our nominee comes, we'll campaign with him.’ … Seconds later, a spokesman for Trump's Wisconsin campaign alerted reporters that the event had been canceled.” (Ryan stumped alongside Mike Pence yesterday.)

-- But perplexingly Trump and Pence have not given up on VIRGINIA, adding several stops and deploying key surrogates. “Trump’s decision to appear in a populous, purple Washington exurb cuts against his broader strategy of running up the vote in heavily red, rural areas,” Laura Vozzella writes. “Much of his last-minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like Selma, N.C., population 6,000. His foray into Northern Virginia appears to be a bid to hold down Clinton’s margins in a region that, excluding the exurbs, leans heavily Democratic.”

-- Bigger picture: Trump’s schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now. It’s not clear where and how he would win. “Of all of [Trump’s must-win] states, the only one where Mr. Trump has really been close in the polls is Nevada,” writes The Upshot’s Nate Cohn. “But Nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting, and it hasn't brought good news for Mr. Trump. … Perhaps Mr. Trump will mount a huge comeback in Nevada on Election Day. Or maybe Democrats are much weaker among registered Democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe. But if Mrs. Clinton does indeed have a big advantage in Nevada, then his chances start looking very bleak: He's at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top. What's more, it's not really clear where he has his best chance — something reflected in Mr. Trump's unfocused pre-election push.”

-- A deep dive on the national mood: Fifteen of our reporters traveled the country talking to voters and report on ""deep anxiety – and some lingering traces of optimism"": “Only eight years after millions of Americans poured into the streets in spontaneous, joyful celebration of the election of the nation’s first black president, optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country’s marrow, replaced by a heavy anxiety, a sense that things aren’t right and can’t easily be fixed.""

-- Early voting trends in FLORIDA appear to (narrowly) favor Clinton: “The Democrats’ lead of 7,280 ballots cast pales in comparison to their advantage of about 104,000 early and absentee votes four years ago, however the state’s voter rolls have shifted significantly and neither Republicans nor Democrats can lay claim to having a clear advantage,” Politico’s Marc Caputo writes.

“I think it's trending well for HRC, but it's definitely a toss up state,” says Democratic consultant Steve Schale, who helped lead Obama's efforts in the Sunshine State in 2008 and 2012. (Read his latest memo on the early vote.)

-- Jon Ralston, the dean of the NEVADA press corps, predicts a deep blue wave in the notoriously-hard-to-poll Silver State: “Trump may have been here this weekend, believing in the polls that show him ahead or competitive here. But like Bruce Willis in ‘The Sixth Sense’ (spoiler alert), he does not realize he is dead. The Democratic early voting effort, which was much more difficult with a nominee so many Democrats don’t like or trust, has been impressive — a valedictory statement from The Reid Machine. Yes, 2016 is not 2012. Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama. Plenty of votes will be cast Tuesday. But: About two-thirds of the votes already have been banked. If the past is prologue … The only real question, I think, is how deep the blue wave goes.”

-- The Supreme Court moved to allow an ARIZONA “ballot collection” law barring organizers from picking up ballots and delivering them to election stations. The move is an eleventh-hour blow to Democrats, who argue that the ruling could disenfranchise thousands of minority voters. (CNN)

-- Chris Christie canceled four NEW HAMPSHIRE stops on behalf of Trump yesterday, following the convictions of two former top aides for their role in the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. The New Jersey governor is doing an interview today with Charlie Rose to try cleaning up the mess. Imagine is Christie was the Republican nominee, and those convictions got handed down the Friday before the election? (WMUR)

-- Faithless elector alert: A WASHINGTON state Democratic elector said he is refusing to vote for Clinton even if she wins the popular vote, facing the potential of a $1,000 fine. He told the AP he “doesn’t care.” This could matter if the election is really close.

-- Some are still Bernie or Bust: Sanders went to Iowa State University in Ames yesterday to lead a rally for Clinton. One of the warm-up speakers was Kaleb Vanfosson, the president of the Young Democratic Socialists group at the school. He was supposed to give a speech about the need for unity, but instead he took the stage and started talking about how ""terrible"" Hillary is. ""She is so trapped in the world of the elite,"" the sophomore in political science said. ""She has completely lost grip of what it's like to be an average person."" He added that there was no point in voting for the ""lesser of two evils."" It took about a minute of this before a Clinton staffer escorted him off the stage. Here’s the story from the student paper. And here’s the video:

-- Tim Kaine made headlines after suggesting that some inside the FBI are “actively working” to support Trump’s campaign. From Ed O’Keefe: In a Miami interview, Kaine called the FBI a “leaky sieve” and accused Jim Comey of breaking protocol by announcing his email investigation so close to an election. He also dismissed Trump ally Rudy Giuliani’s decision to back off claims that he, Giuliani, had been given advance notice of the FBI's plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation. “I don’t think Giuliani’s walk-back is credible,” the Virginia senator said, referring to Giuliani’s preemptive announcement that the FBI had a “big announcement” to come. “I think the FBI sadly has become like a leaky sieve,” he added.

-- New York Times, “If Clinton Moves to Oval Office, Aides’ Baggage May Be Heavy,” by Matt Flegenheimer and Mark Landler: “In the final sprint of her campaign, troubled by an F.B.I. inquiry and narrowing polls, [Clinton] has held tightly to a handful of advisers who have spent their careers protecting her interests, defending her reputation, and at times sullying it — and their own. And if she wins on Tuesday, the most telling test of Mrs. Clinton’s transition back to power will arrive quickly: After a campaign season often defined by voters’ weariness with and distrust of her, which old hands will — or should — follow her into the Oval Office? Almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy: the inquiry into her use of a private email server … and the WikiLeaks hack of [campaign chairman John Podesta]. The unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother Mrs. Clinton much, friends say. The political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter.""

-- Boston Globe A1, “9 moments that molded the campaign,” by Matt Viser and Annie Linskey: “When planning the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Clinton campaign officials didn’t initially include Michelle Obama as a featured speaker, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. … For Clinton’s campaign, it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day — when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were both to speak. ‘We thought it would be hard for Sanders’ people to boo Michelle Obama,’ said the person, who isn’t authorized to talk about the first lady’s deliberations.” Another revelation: The Trump campaign was warned months in advance to be ready for Clinton’s attack over Alicia Machado but did nothing.

-- New Yorker, “Meet Maya Harris, Hillary Clinton’s Progressive Link,” by Emily Greenhouse: “To speak with those who have worked with Harris is to be bulldozed with superlatives. Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, who worked with Harris recently on the Democratic Party platform, told me that ‘she lives her life on a moral crusade on all of those justice issues … She carries her peeps, our peeps, with her in everything she does.’ Beyond policy, Harris seems to offer, in her very person, solutions to some of Clinton’s image problems.""

-- The owners of the National Enquirer reportedly paid to shield Trump from allegations of a former Playboy model who claims they had an affair, paying $150,000 for rights to her story before declining to publish it. From the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Palazzolo, Michael Rothfeld and Lukas I. Alpert: “The tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn’t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as ‘catch and kill.’ In a written statement, the company said it wasn’t buying Ms. McDougal’s story for $150,000, but rather two years’ worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man.” Trump and American Media Owner CEO David Pecker are longtime friends.

-- Melania stumped alongside her husband in North Carolina, calling him a ""compassionate, giving ... loving"" man, she said, who ""cares so deeply about this country.""

-- “In America’s democratic showcase, the world sees a model of what not to do,” by Griff Witte: “In the seaside cafes of Beirut, the whole thing looks ‘like a bad joke.’ To persecuted journalists in Burundi, it amounts to ‘a total loss of dignity.’ The government-scripted press of Beijing diagnoses ‘an empire moving downhill.’ And the spin doctors of the Kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight. The U.S. presidential election — America’s quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on Earth — has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope. People in small and distant countries who count on the U.S. to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components … trammeled. Long-standing allies have been left to wonder … whether the U.S. can be relied on when it counts. And even though the campaign still has days to go — with the outcome very much in doubt — the damage to American moral standing may already be done.”

Quote du jour: “America always spoke to Arab countries as if they had so much to learn,” said a 27-year-old Beirut café worker, who says he has been closely watching the election ever since he read about Trump’s sexual assault boasts. “And now we see their own democracy involves choosing between a woman from a dynasty and a man who says the system is manipulated. If that’s democracy, then we don’t want it.”

-- The New York Times’ Farah Stockman and Nick Corasaniti explore how this loss of luster could affect the American brand: “In interviews, Americans who travel overseas and foreign observers say that tourists who once felt themselves the envy of the world now feel the sting of embarrassment. Businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the American dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns."" An Australian public relations consultant noted that state lawmakers in Sydney recently adopted a resolution – by unanimous consent – describing Trump as ""a revolting slug” unfit for office.

-- The idea that Tuesday will end our partisan rancor is a “naïve fantasy,"" writes Frank Bruni:“There’s no end here, just a punctuation mark, a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come. And there’s no way to un-see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months, to bottle up what has been un-bottled. Election Day will redeem and settle nothing, not this time around. Whether balloons fall on [Clinton] or [Trump], there will be bolder divisions in America than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country’s most important institutions … Even putting Trump’s angry troops aside, it feels as if we’re coming out of this election with four parties: the Paul Ryan Republicans, the Freedom Caucus, the establishment Democrats and the Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders brigade … Meet the new paralysis, same as the old paralysis. Potentially, worse. From elections past, I don’t recognize this terrain. How can I assume that it’s navigable?”

-- “If [Trump] loses, the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge,” says conservative columnist Peter Wehner, who served in the Bush and Reagan administrations: “Policies that promote economic growth, social mobility and greater opportunity are important. But in some respects the party’s stance [here] is a secondary priority. Republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first: Will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions, or not; who conceive of America as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed … who abhor ignorance or embrace it? In a post-Trump world, Republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments. Can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite America? Does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions? Does it believe in a just social order or not? The next few months will tell us a lot about whether Mr. Trump and Trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that Lincoln helped create.""

-- “When historians write about this bizarre, ugly and dispiriti",FAKE,raleigh ncayana mcallister went to hillary clintons rally two weekends ago at st augustines university the historicallyblack school where shes a freshman she watched the democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of trayvon martin and sandra bland but on the eve of the election the yearold is still not  percent sold i dont know said mcallister a native of largo md i feel like ive got to settle for hillary i feel like im going to vote because i know i need to not because i want to i feel like neither of them should be president but i feel like hillary will be better really its like two children arguing back and forth this was a common refrain during interviews at yesterdays football game here between st augustine and crosstown rival shaw university another historicallyblack institution  early voting numbers and polling suggest that african american turnout is down nationally this year compared to  and  though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the clinton high command  many students at the schools here in raleigh regret that they never got to vote for barack obama they are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between clinton and donald trump but they plan to vote nonetheless in fact teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on tuesday i am not a fan of either one but of the two i will probably be voting for hillary said anoviua rush a freshman from durham shes just a liar and hillary is not even good at backing up her lies everyone makes mistakes but when you try to cover them up its a problem as a marching band performed behind her under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her but clintons support for equal pay legislation does shes more understanding of minorities and what we go through said rush im not going to say hes racist but hes said some messed up stuff about minorities  donalds main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and ill say it possibly caucasians  a lot of people are very discouraged very very discouraged said felishia mcpherson  who was wearing a black lives matter tshirt really its like youre choosing between a liar and a clown but who doesnt lie we all lie  im a mental health counselor i know that psychologically in order to want to be president youve got to be a little narcissistic to start with  trump was never an option for me i dont love hillary but i dont have to shes not coming to my house shes going to the white house mcpherson already voted early for clinton she brought her sevenyearold niece malia named after the presidents daughter to obamas rally in fayetteville on friday i dont know if i actually believe in the political system as far as does my one vote count but im not going to take a chance of it not counting she explained afterward if the system really does work then im going to participate if it doesnt then i still did the best i could by my ancestors  i do believe with obamas encouragement even though we may not believe in the system we know we need to do it  several elderly african americans expressed deep concern that millennials including their grandchildren do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting irene hillthomas  is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in sampson county if youve been around long enough your eyes are open she said you appreciate it because you fought for it the younger generation hasnt been there they dont know the younger generation doesnt understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so  i remember the white and the colored fountains they dont  north carolina was the closest state obama won in  and the closest state he lost in  african americans accounted for  percent of the electorate both times and obama won almost all of them reflecting the importance of the  electoral votes up for grabs in north carolina and the strategic significance of the research triangle specifically both candidates will return to raleigh on monday trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds and clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here  at midnight  another very important explanation for why african american turnout is down in north carolina republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours the executive director of the state republican party persuaded gop county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests he pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open especially evenings and sundays when many african americans typically cast ballots after church services in the democraticleaning county that includes greensboro  the states third largest  there were  early voting sites in  during the first week that polls were open this year there was just one so while  people voted during the first week four years ago only  did this year after that first week  voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken  i shadowed a field staffer from the aflcio affiliate group working america as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of raleigh yesterday afternoon walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off martin luther king jr blvd andrea vogler urged folks to go vote during a period of just one hour though half a dozen african americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long so they came home they all said they hope to still go on tuesday but what if the lines are long then too will they stick around a woman in a nurses uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week but the lines were too long each time a younger man named victor came to his door in redcheckered pajamas he had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around he works a night shift so he said hes going to try voting on his drive home from work at  am tuesday  which he hopes will be before a crowd forms ive heard that on a couple of different days now vogler  lamented as she walked to the next house on the one hand it is good people are trying to vote on the other i hope it doesnt deter anyone from actually voting a woman named barbara pulling out of her driveway in a chevy trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines damien her husband was who vogler had come to talk with barbara warned her that he was sleeping but every vote counts so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway he was nonplussed i worked all damn night  hours he said his eyes bloodshot i just want to go back to my bed she tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for clinton he grimaced and refused to take it working america has about  field staffers farmed out across nine states they have had  conversations with voters since launching this summer including  in north carolina in the raleigh area alone the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on saturday the group largely targets african american and latino voters though some swing white republicans are in their universe an older man sitting in his green chevy lumina picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of groundlevel studio apartments told vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon she informed him that early voting had ended for the day and that saturday was the final opportunity until tuesday damn he replied north carolina is the most important state vogler stressed over and over again youve got to get out to vote  in an interview late last night i asked democratic senate candidate deborah ross  who is in a neckandneck race with sen richard burr that may decide which party controls the majority  about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines its by design she complained but she argued that this will also galvanize many african americans on tuesday i dont think anything is going to keep people from voting this year she said ross a former state representative who sponsored  legislation allowing for sameday voter registration which was pivotal to obama carrying the state a year later noted that for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites many more waited around there were people who stood for hours in line she said the weather forecast for tuesday looks good and she believes this might make the difference in her razor thin race i think were going to see long lines on election day ross predicted with a southern twang were going to turn people out a clinton campaign official speaking anonymously said they were worried during the first week of early voting but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout but allies say clinton may need to perform especially well on election day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks surrogates have also streamed into the state

not clear where and how he would win of all of trumps mustwin states the only one where mr trump has really been close in the polls is nevada writes the upshots nate cohn but nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting and it hasnt brought good news for mr trump  perhaps mr trump will mount a huge comeback in nevada on election day or maybe democrats are much weaker among registered democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe but if mrs clinton does indeed have a big advantage in nevada then his chances start looking very bleak hes at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top whats more its not really clear where he has his best chance  something reflected in mr trumps unfocused
